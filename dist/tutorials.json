      "body": "About Electron\nElectron is an open source library developed by GitHub for building cross-platform desktop applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Electron accomplishes this by combining Chromium and Node.js into a single runtime and apps can be packaged for Mac, Windows, and Linux.\nElectron began in 2013 as the framework on which Atom, GitHub's hackable text editor, would be built. The two were open sourced in the Spring of 2014.\nIt has since become a popular tool used by open source developers, startups, and established companies. See who is building on Electron.\nRead on to learn more about the contributors and releases of Electron or get started building with Electron in the Quick Start Guide.\n\n\nCore Team and Contributors\nElectron is maintained by a team at GitHub as well as a group of active contributors from the community. Some of the contributors are individuals and some work at larger companies who are developing on Electron. We're happy to add frequent contributors to the project as maintainers. Read more about contributing to Electron.\n\n\nReleases\nElectron releases frequently. We release when there are significant bug fixes, new APIs or are updating versions of Chromium or Node.js.\n\n\nUpdating Dependencies\nElectron's version of Chromium is usually updated within one or two weeks after a new stable Chromium version is released, depending on the effort involved in the upgrade.\nWhen a new version of Node.js is released, Electron usually waits about a month before upgrading in order to bring in a more stable version.\nIn Electron, Node.js and Chromium share a single V8 instance—usually the version that Chromium is using. Most of the time this just works but sometimes it means patching Node.js.\n\n\nVersioning\nAs of version 2.0 Electron follows semver.\nFor most applications, and using any recent version of npm,\nrunning $ npm install electron will do the right thing.\nThe version update process is detailed explicitly in our Versioning Doc.\n\n\nLTS\nLong term support of older versions of Electron does not currently exist. If your current version of Electron works for you, you can stay on it for as long as you'd like. If you want to make use of new features as they come in you should upgrade to a newer version.\nA major update came with version v1.0.0. If you're not yet using this version, you should read more about the v1.0.0 changes.\n\n\nCore Philosophy\nIn order to keep Electron small (file size) and sustainable (the spread of dependencies and APIs) the project limits the scope of the core project.\nFor instance, Electron uses Chromium's rendering library rather than all of Chromium. This makes it easier to upgrade Chromium but also means some browser features found in Google Chrome do not exist in Electron.\nNew features added to Electron should primarily be native APIs. If a feature can be its own Node.js module, it probably should be. See the Electron tools built by the community.\n\n\nHistory\nBelow are milestones in Electron's history.\n\n\n\n📆\n🎉\n\n\n\n\nApril 2013\nAtom Shell is started\n.\n\n\nMay 2014\nAtom Shell is open sourced\n.\n\n\nApril 2015\nAtom Shell is re-named Electron\n.\n\n\nMay 2016\nElectron releases v1.0.0\n.\n\n\nMay 2016\nElectron apps compatible with Mac App Store\n.\n\n\nAugust 2016\nWindows Store support for Electron apps\n.\n\n\n\n",

With Electron apps, however,\nyou can't use the online resources for accessibility audits because your app\ndoesn't have a URL to point the auditor to.\nThese new features bring those auditing tools to your Electron app. You can\nchoose to add audits to your tests with Spectron or use them within DevTools\nwith Devtron. Read on for a summary of the tools.\n\n\nSpectron\nIn the testing framework Spectron, you can now audit each window and <webview>\ntag in your application. For example:\napp.client.auditAccessibility().then(function (audit) {\n  if (audit.failed) {\n    console.error(audit.message)\n  }\n})\nYou can read more about this feature in Spectron's documentation.\n\n\nDevtron\nIn Devtron, there is a new accessibility tab which will allow you to audit a\npage in your app, sort and filter the results.\n\nBoth of these tools are using the Accessibility Developer Tools\nlibrary built by Google for Chrome. You can learn more about the accessibility\naudit rules this library uses on that repository's wiki.\nIf you know of other great accessibility tools for Electron, add them to the\naccessibility documentation with a pull request.\n\n\nEnabling Accessibility\nElectron applications keep accessibility disabled by default for performance\nreasons but there are multiple ways to enable it.\n\n\nInside Application\nBy using app.setAccessibilitySupportEnabled(enabled),\nyou can expose accessibility switch to users in the application preferences.\nUser's system assistive utilities have priority over this setting and will\noverride it.\n\n\nAssistive Technology\nElectron application will enable accessibility automatically when it detects\nassistive technology (Windows) or VoiceOver (macOS). See Chrome's\naccessibility documentation for more details.\nOn macOS, third-party assistive technology can switch accessibility inside\nElectron applications by setting the attribute AXManualAccessibility\nprogrammatically:\nCFStringRef kAXManualAccessibility = CFSTR(\"AXManualAccessibility\");\n\n+ (void)enableAccessibility:(BOOL)enable inElectronApplication:(NSRunningApplication *)app\n{\n    AXUIElementRef appRef = AXUIElementCreateApplication(app.processIdentifier);\n    if (appRef == nil)\n        return;\n\n    CFBooleanRef value = enable ? kCFBooleanTrue : kCFBooleanFalse;\n    AXUIElementSetAttributeValue(appRef, kAXManualAccessibility, value);\n    CFRelease(appRef);\n}\n",

      "slug": "application-architecture",
      "body": "Electron Application Architecture\nBefore we can dive into Electron's APIs, we need to discuss the two process\ntypes available in Electron. They are fundamentally different and important to\nunderstand.\n\n\nMain and Renderer Processes\nIn Electron, the process that runs package.json's main script is called\nthe main process. The script that runs in the main process can display a\nGUI by creating web pages. An Electron app always has one main process, but\nnever more.\nSince Electron uses Chromium for displaying web pages, Chromium's\nmulti-process architecture is also used. Each web page in Electron runs in\nits own process, which is called the renderer process.\nIn normal browsers, web pages usually run in a sandboxed environment and are not\nallowed access to native resources. Electron users, however, have the power to\nuse Node.js APIs in web pages allowing lower level operating system\ninteractions.\n\n\nDifferences Between Main Process and Renderer Process\nThe main process creates web pages by creating BrowserWindow instances. Each\nBrowserWindow instance runs the web page in its own renderer process. When a\nBrowserWindow instance is destroyed, the corresponding renderer process\nis also terminated.\nThe main process manages all web pages and their corresponding renderer\nprocesses. Each renderer process is isolated and only cares about the web page\nrunning in it.\nIn web pages, calling native GUI related APIs is not allowed because managing\nnative GUI resources in web pages is very dangerous and it is easy to leak\nresources. If you want to perform GUI operations in a web page, the renderer\nprocess of the web page must communicate with the main process to request that\nthe main process perform those operations.\n\nAside: Communication Between Processes\nIn Electron, we have several ways to communicate between the main process\nand renderer processes, such as ipcRenderer and\nipcMain modules for sending messages, and the\nremote module for RPC style communication. There is also\nan FAQ entry on how to share data between web pages.\n\n\n\nUsing Electron APIs\nElectron offers a number of APIs that support the development of a desktop\napplication in both the main process and the renderer process. In both\nprocesses, you'd access Electron's APIs by requiring its included module:\nconst electron = require('electron')\nAll Electron APIs are assigned a process type. Many of them can only be\nused from the main process, some of them only from a renderer process,\nsome from both. The documentation for each individual API will\nstate which process it can be used from.\nA window in Electron is for instance created using the BrowserWindow\nclass. It is only available in the main process.\n// This will work in the main process, but be `undefined` in a\n// renderer process:\nconst { BrowserWindow } = require('electron')\n\nconst win = new BrowserWindow()\nSince communication between the processes is possible, a renderer process\ncan call upon the main process to perform tasks. Electron comes with a\nmodule called remote that exposes APIs usually only available on the\nmain process. In order to create a BrowserWindow from a renderer process,\nwe'd use the remote as a middle-man:\n// This will work in a renderer process, but be `undefined` in the\n// main process:\nconst { remote } = require('electron')\nconst { BrowserWindow } = remote\n\nconst win = new BrowserWindow()\n\n\nUsing Node.js APIs\nElectron exposes full access to Node.js both in the main and the renderer\nprocess. This has two important implications:\n1) All APIs available in Node.js are available in Electron. Calling the\nfollowing code from an Electron app works:\nconst fs = require('fs')\n\nconst root = fs.readdirSync('/')\n\n// This will print all files at the root-level of the disk,\n// either '/' or 'C:\\'.\nconsole.log(root)\nAs you might already be able to guess, this has important security implications\nif you ever attempt to load remote content. You can find more information and\nguidance on loading remote content in our security documentation.\n2) You can use Node.js modules in your application. Pick your favorite npm\nmodule. npm offers currently the world's biggest repository of open-source\ncode – the ability to use well-maintained and tested code that used to be\nreserved for server applications is one of the key features of Electron.\nAs an example, to use the official AWS SDK in your application, you'd first\ninstall it as a dependency:\nnpm install --save aws-sdk\nThen, in your Electron app, require and use the module as if you were\nbuilding a Node.js application:\n// A ready-to-use S3 Client\nconst S3 = require('aws-sdk/clients/s3')\nThere is one important caveat: Native Node.js modules (that is, modules that\nrequire compilation of native code before they can be used) will need to be\ncompiled to be used with Electron.\nThe vast majority of Node.js modules are not native. Only 400 out of the\n~650.000 modules are native. However, if you do need native modules, please\nconsult this guide on how to recompile them for Electron.\n",

It is available for all renderer processes,\nincluding instances of BrowserWindow, BrowserView, and WebView. You\ncan open them programmatically by calling the openDevTools() API on the\nwebContents of the instance:\nconst { BrowserWindow } = require('electron')\n\nlet win = new BrowserWindow()\nwin.webContents.openDevTools()\nGoogle offers excellent documentation for their developer tools.\nWe recommend that you make yourself familiar with them - they are usually one\nof the most powerful utilities in any Electron Developer's tool belt.\n\n\nMain Process\nDebugging the main process is a bit trickier, since you cannot open\ndeveloper tools for them.

      "body": "Application Distribution\nTo distribute your app with Electron, you need to package and rebrand it. The easiest way to do this is to use one of the following third party packaging tools:\n\nelectron-forge\nelectron-builder\nelectron-packager\n\nThese tools will take care of all the steps you need to take to end up with a distributable Electron applications, such as packaging your application, rebranding the executable, setting the right icons and optionally creating installers.\n\n\nManual distribution\nYou can also choose to manually get your app ready for distribution. The steps needed to do this are outlined below.\nTo distribute your app with Electron, you need to download Electron's prebuilt\nbinaries. Next, the folder\ncontaining your app should be named app and placed in Electron's resources\ndirectory as shown in the following examples. Note that the location of\nElectron's prebuilt binaries is indicated with electron/ in the examples\nbelow.\nOn macOS:\nelectron/Electron.app/Contents/Resources/app/\n├── package.json\n├── main.js\n└── index.html\nOn Windows and Linux:\nelectron/resources/app\n├── package.json\n├── main.js\n└── index.html\nThen execute Electron.app (or electron on Linux, electron.exe on Windows),\nand Electron will start as your app. The electron directory will then be\nyour distribution to deliver to final users.\n\n\nPackaging Your App into a File\nApart from shipping your app by copying all of its source files, you can also\npackage your app into an asar archive to avoid\nexposing your app's source code to users.\nTo use an asar archive to replace the app folder, you need to rename the\narchive to app.asar, and put it under Electron's resources directory like\nbelow, and Electron will then try to read the archive and start from it.\nOn macOS:\nelectron/Electron.app/Contents/Resources/\n└── app.asar\nOn Windows and Linux:\nelectron/resources/\n└── app.asar\nMore details can be found in Application packaging.\n\n\nRebranding with Downloaded Binaries\nAfter bundling your app into Electron, you will want to rebrand Electron\nbefore distributing it to users.\n\n\nWindows\nYou can rename electron.exe to any name you like, and edit its icon and other\ninformation with tools like rcedit.\n\n\nmacOS\nYou can rename Electron.app to any name you want, and you also have to rename\nthe CFBundleDisplayName, CFBundleIdentifier and CFBundleName fields in the\nfollowing files:\n\nElectron.app/Contents/Info.plist\nElectron.app/Contents/Frameworks/Electron Helper.app/Contents/Info.plist\n\nYou can also rename the helper app to avoid showing Electron Helper in the\nActivity Monitor, but make sure you have renamed the helper app's executable\nfile's name.\nThe structure of a renamed app would be like:\nMyApp.app/Contents\n├── Info.plist\n├── MacOS/\n│   └── MyApp\n└── Frameworks/\n    └── MyApp Helper.app\n        ├── Info.plist\n        └── MacOS/\n            └── MyApp Helper\n\n\nLinux\nYou can rename the electron executable to any name you like.\n\n\nRebranding by Rebuilding Electron from Source\nIt is also possible to rebrand Electron by changing the product name and\nbuilding it from source. To do this you need to set the build argument\ncorresponding to the product name (electron_product_name = \"YourProductName\")\nin the args.gn file and rebuild.\n\n\nCreating a Custom Electron Fork\nCreating a custom fork of Electron is almost certainly not something you will\nneed to do in order to build your app, even for \"Production Level\" applications.\nUsing a tool such as electron-packager or electron-forge will allow you to\n\"Rebrand\" Electron without having to do these steps.\nYou need to fork Electron when you have custom C++ code that you have patched\ndirectly into Electron, that either cannot be upstreamed, or has been rejected\nfrom the official version. As maintainers of Electron, we very much would like\nto make your scenario work, so please try as hard as you can to get your changes\ninto the official version of Electron, it will be much much easier on you, and\nwe appreciate your help.\n\n\nCreating a Custom Release with surf-build\n\n\nInstall Surf, via npm:\nnpm install -g surf-build@latest\n\n\nCreate a new S3 bucket and create the following empty directory structure:\n- electron/\n  - symbols/\n  - dist/\n\n\nSet the following Environment Variables:\n\n\n\nELECTRON_GITHUB_TOKEN - a token that can create releases on GitHub\nELECTRON_S3_ACCESS_KEY, ELECTRON_S3_BUCKET, ELECTRON_S3_SECRET_KEY -\nthe place where you'll upload Node.js headers as well as symbols\nELECTRON_RELEASE - Set to true and the upload part will run, leave unset\nand surf-build will do CI-type checks, appropriate to run for every\npull request.\nCI - Set to true or else it will fail\nGITHUB_TOKEN - set it to the same as ELECTRON_GITHUB_TOKEN\nSURF_TEMP - set to C:\\Temp on Windows to prevent path too long issues\nTARGET_ARCH - set to ia32 or x64\n\n\n\nIn script/upload.py, you must set ELECTRON_REPO to your fork (MYORG/electron),\nespecially if you are a contributor to Electron proper.\n\n\nsurf-build -r https://github.com/MYORG/electron -s YOUR_COMMIT -n 'surf-PLATFORM-ARCH'\n\n\nWait a very, very long time for the build to complete.\n\n\n",

      "body": "Application Packaging\nTo mitigate issues around long\npath names on Windows, slightly speed up require and conceal your source code\nfrom cursory inspection, you can choose to package your app into an asar\narchive with little changes to your source code.\nMost users will get this feature for free, since it's supported out of the box\nby electron-packager, electron-forge,\nand electron-builder. If you are not using any of these\ntools, read on.\n\n\nGenerating asar Archives\nAn asar archive is a simple tar-like format that concatenates files\ninto a single file. Electron can read arbitrary files from it without unpacking\nthe whole file.\nSteps to package your app into an asar archive:\n\n\n1. Install the asar Utility\n$ npm install -g asar\n\n\n2. Package with asar pack\n$ asar pack your-app app.asar\n\n\nUsing asar Archives\nIn Electron there are two sets of APIs: Node APIs provided by Node.js and Web\nAPIs provided by Chromium. Both APIs support reading files from asar archives.\n\n\nNode API\nWith special patches in Electron, Node APIs like fs.readFile and require\ntreat asar archives as virtual directories, and the files in it as normal\nfiles in the filesystem.\nFor example, suppose we have an example.asar archive under /path/to:\n$ asar list /path/to/example.asar\n/app.js\n/file.txt\n/dir/module.js\n/static/index.html\n/static/main.css\n/static/jquery.min.js\nRead a file in the asar archive:\nconst fs = require('fs')\nfs.readFileSync('/path/to/example.asar/file.txt')\nList all files under the root of the archive:\nconst fs = require('fs')\nfs.readdirSync('/path/to/example.asar')\nUse a module from the archive:\nrequire('/path/to/example.asar/dir/module.js')\nYou can also display a web page in an asar archive with BrowserWindow:\nconst { BrowserWindow } = require('electron')\nconst win = new BrowserWindow()\n\nwin.loadURL('file:///path/to/example.asar/static/index.html')\n\n\nWeb API\nIn a web page, files in an archive can be requested with the file: protocol.\nLike the Node API, asar archives are treated as directories.\nFor example, to get a file with $.get:\n<script>\nlet $ = require('./jquery.min.js')\n$.get('file:///path/to/example.asar/file.txt', (data) => {\n  console.log(data)\n})\n</script>\n\n\nTreating an asar Archive as a Normal File\nFor some cases like verifying the asar archive's checksum, we need to read the\ncontent of an asar archive as a file. For this purpose you can use the built-in\noriginal-fs module which provides original fs APIs without asar support:\nconst originalFs = require('original-fs')\noriginalFs.readFileSync('/path/to/example.asar')\nYou can also set process.noAsar to true to disable the support for asar in\nthe fs module:\nconst fs = require('fs')\nprocess.noAsar = true\nfs.readFileSync('/path/to/example.asar')\n\n\nLimitations of the Node API\nEven though we tried hard to make asar archives in the Node API work like\ndirectories as much as possible, there are still limitations due to the\nlow-level nature of the Node API.\n\n\nArchives Are Read-only\nThe archives can not be modified so all Node APIs that can modify files will not\nwork with asar archives.\n\n\nWorking Directory Can Not Be Set to Directories in Archive\nThough asar archives are treated as directories, there are no actual\ndirectories in the filesystem, so you can never set the working directory to\ndirectories in asar archives. Passing them as the cwd option of some APIs\nwill also cause errors.\n\n\nExtra Unpacking on Some APIs\nMost fs APIs can read a file or get a file's information from asar archives\nwithout unpacking, but for some APIs that rely on passing the real file path to\nunderlying system calls, Electron will extract the needed file into a\ntemporary file and pass the path of the temporary file to the APIs to make them\nwork. This adds a little overhead for those APIs.\nAPIs that requires extra unpacking are:\n\nchild_process.execFile\nchild_process.execFileSync\nfs.open\nfs.openSync\nprocess.dlopen - Used by require on native modules\n\n\n\nFake Stat Information of fs.stat\nThe Stats object returned by fs.stat and its friends on files in asar\narchives is generated by guessing, because those files do not exist on the\nfilesystem. So you should not trust the Stats object except for getting file\nsize and checking file type.\n\n\nExecuting Binaries Inside asar Archive\nThere are Node APIs that can execute binaries like child_process.exec,\nchild_process.spawn and child_process.execFile, but only execFile is\nsupported to execute binaries inside asar archive.\nThis is because exec and spawn accept command instead of file as input,\nand commands are executed under shell. There is no reliable way to determine\nwhether a command uses a file in asar archive, and even if we do, we can not be\nsure whether we can replace the path in command without side effects.\n\n\nAdding Unpacked Files to asar Archives\nAs stated above, some Node APIs will unpack the file to the filesystem when\ncalled. Apart from the performance issues, various anti-virus scanners might\nbe triggered by this behavior.\nAs a workaround, you can leave various files unpacked using the --unpack option.\nIn the following example, shared libraries of native Node.js modules will not be\npacked:\n$ asar pack app app.asar --unpack *.node\nAfter running the command, you will notice that a folder named app.asar.unpacked\nwas created together with the app.asar file. It contains the unpacked files\nand should be shipped together with the app.asar archive.\n",

Entry of Application\nIn NW.js the main entry point of an application is a web page or a JS script. You specify a\nhtml or js file in the package.json and it is opened in a browser window as\nthe application's main window (in case of an html entrypoint) or the script is executed.\nIn Electron, the entry point is a JavaScript script. Instead of\nproviding a URL directly, you manually create a browser window and load\nan HTML file using the API. You also need to listen to window events\nto decide when to quit the application.\nElectron works more like the Node.js runtime. Electron's APIs are lower level\nso you can use it for browser testing in place of PhantomJS.\n2. Build System\nIn order to avoid the complexity of building all of Chromium, Electron uses libchromiumcontent to access\nChromium's Content API. libchromiumcontent is a single shared library that\nincludes the Chromium Content module and all of its dependencies. Users don't\nneed a powerful machine to build Electron.\n3. Node Integration\nIn NW.js, the Node integration in web pages requires patching Chromium to\nwork, while in Electron we chose a different way to integrate the libuv loop\nwith each platform's message loop to avoid hacking Chromium. See the\nnode_bindings code for how that was done.\n4. Multi-context\nIf you are an experienced NW.js user, you should be familiar with the\nconcept of Node context and web context. These concepts were invented because\nof how NW.js was implemented.\nBy using the multi-context\nfeature of Node, Electron doesn't introduce a new JavaScript context in web\npages.\nNote: NW.js has optionally supported multi-context since 0.13.\n",

      "body": "Automated Testing with a Custom Driver\nTo write automated tests for your Electron app, you will need a way to \"drive\" your application. Spectron is a commonly-used solution which lets you emulate user actions via WebDriver. However, it's also possible to write your own custom driver using node's builtin IPC-over-STDIO. The benefit of a custom driver is that it tends to require less overhead than Spectron, and lets you expose custom methods to your test suite.\nTo create a custom driver, we'll use Node.js' child_process API. The test suite will spawn the Electron process, then establish a simple messaging protocol:\nvar childProcess = require('child_process')\nvar electronPath = require('electron')\n\n// spawn the process\nvar env = { /* ... */ }\nvar stdio = ['inherit', 'inherit', 'inherit', 'ipc']\nvar appProcess = childProcess.spawn(electronPath, ['./app'], { stdio, env })\n\n// listen for IPC messages from the app\nappProcess.on('message', (msg) => {\n  // ...\n})\n\n// send an IPC message to the app\nappProcess.send({ my: 'message' })\nFrom within the Electron app, you can listen for messages and send replies using the Node.js process API:\n// listen for IPC messages from the test suite\nprocess.on('message', (msg) => {\n  // ...\n})\n\n// send an IPC message to the test suite\nprocess.send({ my: 'message' })\nWe can now communicate from the test suite to the Electron app using the appProcess object.\nFor convenience, you may want to wrap appProcess in a driver object that provides more high-level functions. Here is an example of how you can do this:\nclass TestDriver {\n  constructor ({ path, args, env }) {\n    this.rpcCalls = []\n\n    // start child process\n    env.APP_TEST_DRIVER = 1 // let the app know it should listen for messages\n    this.process = childProcess.spawn(path, args, { stdio: ['inherit', 'inherit', 'inherit', 'ipc'], env })\n\n    // handle rpc responses\n    this.process.on('message', (message) => {\n      // pop the handler\n      var rpcCall = this.rpcCalls[message.msgId]\n      if (!rpcCall) return\n      this.rpcCalls[message.msgId] = null\n      // reject/resolve\n      if (message.reject) rpcCall.reject(message.reject)\n      else rpcCall.resolve(message.resolve)\n    })\n\n    // wait for ready\n    this.isReady = this.rpc('isReady').catch((err) => {\n      console.error('Application failed to start', err)\n      this.stop()\n      process.exit(1)\n    })\n  }\n\n  // simple RPC call\n  // to use: driver.rpc('method', 1, 2, 3).then(...)\n  async rpc (cmd, ...args) {\n    // send rpc request\n    var msgId = this.rpcCalls.length\n    this.process.send({ msgId, cmd, args })\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => this.rpcCalls.push({ resolve, reject }))\n  }\n\n  stop () {\n    this.process.kill()\n  }\n}\nIn the app, you'd need to write a simple handler for the RPC calls:\nif (process.env.APP_TEST_DRIVER) {\n  process.on('message', onMessage)\n}\n\nasync function onMessage ({ msgId, cmd, args }) {\n  var method = METHODS[cmd]\n  if (!method) method = () => new Error('Invalid method: ' + cmd)\n  try {\n    var resolve = await method(...args)\n    process.send({ msgId, resolve })\n  } catch (err) {\n    var reject = {\n      message: err.message,\n      stack: err.stack,\n      name: err.name\n    }\n    process.send({ msgId, reject })\n  }\n}\n\nconst METHODS = {\n  isReady () {\n    // do any setup needed\n    return true\n  }\n  // define your RPC-able methods here\n}\nThen, in your test suite, you can use your test-driver as follows:\nvar test = require('ava')\nvar electronPath = require('electron')\n\nvar app = new TestDriver({\n  path: electronPath,\n  args: ['./app'],\n  env: {\n    NODE_ENV: 'test'\n  }\n})\ntest.before(async t => {\n  await app.isReady\n})\ntest.after.always('cleanup', async t => {\n  await app.stop()\n})\n",

Occasionally, these VM images need to be updated due to changes in Chromium requirements.  In order to update you will need PowerShell and the Azure PowerShell module.\nOccasionally we need to update these images owing to changes in Chromium or other miscellaneous build requirement changes.\nExample Use Case:\n* We need VS15.9 and we have VS15.7 installed; this would require us to update an Azure image.\n\n\nIdentify the image you wish to modify.\n\n\nIn appveyor.yml, the image is identified by the property image.\n\nThe names used correspond to the \"images\" defined for a build cloud, eg the libcc-20 cloud.\n\n\n\nFind the image you wish to modify in the build cloud and make note of the VHD Blob Path for that image, which is the value for that corresponding key.\n\nYou will need this URI path to copy into a new image.\n\n\nYou will also need the storage account name which is labeled in AppVeyor as the Disk Storage Account Name\n\n\n\nGet the Azure storage account key\n\n\nLog into Azure using credentials stored in LastPass (under Azure Enterprise) and then find the storage account corresponding to the name found in AppVeyor.\n\n\nExample, for appveyorlibccbuilds Disk Storage Account Name you'd look for appveyorlibccbuilds in the list of storage accounts @ Home < Storage Accounts\n\nClick into it and look for Access Keys, and then you can use any of the keys present in the list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the full virtual machine image URI from Azure\n\n\nNavigate to Home < Storage Accounts < $ACCT_NAME < Blobs < Images\n\n\nIn the following list, look for the VHD path name you got from Appveyor and then click on it.\n\nCopy the whole URL from the top of the subsequent window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy the image using the Copy Master Image PowerShell script.\n\nIt is essential to copy the VM because if you spin up a VM against an image that image cannot at the same time be used by AppVeyor.\n\nUse the storage account name, key, and URI obtained from Azure to run this script.\n\nSee Step 3 for URI & when prompted, press enter to use same storage account as destination.\nUse default destination container name (images)\n\nAlso, when naming the copy, use a name that indicates what the new image will contain (if that has changed) and date stamp.\n\nEx. libcc-20core-vs2017-15.9-2019-04-15.vhd\n\n\n\n\nGo into Azure and get the URI for the newly created image as described in a previous step\n\n\n\nSpin up a new VM using the Create Master VM from VHD PowerShell.\n\nFrom PowerShell, execute ps1 file with ./create_master_vm_from_vhd.ps1\n\nYou will need the credential information available in the AppVeyor build cloud definition.\n\n\nThis includes:\n\nClient ID\nClient Secret\nTenant ID\nSubscription ID\nResource Group\nVirtual Network\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will also need to specify\n\nMaster VM name - just a unique name to identify the temporary VM\nMaster VM size - use Standard_F32s_v2\nMaster VHD URI - use URI obtained @ end of previous step\nLocation use East US\n\n\n\n\n\nLog back into Azure and find the VM you just created in Homee < Virtual Machines < $YOUR_NEW_VM\n\nYou can download a RDP (Remote Desktop) file to access the VM.\n\n\n\nUsing Microsoft Remote Desktop, click Connect to connect to the VM.\n\nCredentials for logging into the VM are found in LastPass under the AppVeyor Enterprise master VM credentials.\n\n\n\nModify the VM as required.\n\n\nShut down the VM and then delete it in Azure.\n\n\nAdd the new image to the Appveyor Cloud settings or modify an existing image to point to the new VHD.\n\n\n",

To do this, set a GIT_CACHE_PATH\nenvironment variable:\n$ export GIT_CACHE_PATH=\"${HOME}/.git_cache\"\n$ mkdir -p \"${GIT_CACHE_PATH}\"\n# This will use about 16G.\n\n\nsccache\nThousands of files must be compiled to build Chromium and Electron.\nYou can avoid much of the wait by reusing Electron CI's build output via\nsccache. This requires some\noptional steps (listed below) and these two environment variables:\nexport SCCACHE_BUCKET=\"electronjs-sccache\"\nexport SCCACHE_TWO_TIER=true\n\n\nGetting the code\n$ mkdir electron-gn && cd electron-gn\n$ gclient config --name \"src/electron\" --unmanaged https://github.com/electron/electron\n$ gclient sync --with_branch_heads --with_tags\n# This will take a while, go get a coffee.\n\nInstead of https://github.com/electron/electron, you can use your own fork\nhere (something like https://github.com/<username>/electron).\n\n\n\nA note on pulling/pushing\nIf you intend to git pull or git push from the official electron\nrepository in the future, you now need to update the respective folder's\norigin URLs.\n$ cd src/electron\n$ git remote remove origin\n$ git remote add origin https://github.com/electron/electron\n$ git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master\n$ cd -\n📝 gclient works by checking a file called DEPS inside the\nsrc/electron folder for dependencies (like Chromium or Node.js).\nRunning gclient sync -f ensures that all dependencies required\nto build Electron match that file.\nSo, in order to pull, you'd run the following commands:\n$ cd src/electron\n$ git pull\n$ gclient sync -f\n\n\nBuilding\n$ cd src\n$ export CHROMIUM_BUILDTOOLS_PATH=`pwd`/buildtools\n# this next line is needed only if building with sccache\n$ export GN_EXTRA_ARGS=\"${GN_EXTRA_ARGS} cc_wrapper=\\\"${PWD}/electron/external_binaries/sccache\\\"\"\n$ gn gen out/Debug --args=\"import(\\\"//electron/build/args/debug.gn\\\") $GN_EXTRA_ARGS\"\nOr on Windows (without the optional argument):\n$ cd src\n$ set CHROMIUM_BUILDTOOLS_PATH=%cd%\\buildtools\n$ gn gen out/Debug --args=\"import(\\\"//electron/build/args/debug.gn\\\")\"\nThis will generate a build directory out/Debug under src/ with\ndebug build configuration. You can replace Debug with another name,\nbut it should be a subdirectory of out.\nAlso you shouldn't have to run gn gen again—if you want to change the\nbuild arguments, you can run gn args out/Debug to bring up an editor.\nTo see the list of available build configuration options, run gn args out/Debug --list.\nFor generating Debug (aka \"component\" or \"shared\") build config of\nElectron:\n$ gn gen out/Debug --args=\"import(\\\"//electron/build/args/debug.gn\\\") $GN_EXTRA_ARGS\"\nFor generating Release (aka \"non-component\" or \"static\") build config of\nElectron:\n$ gn gen out/Release --args=\"import(\\\"//electron/build/args/release.gn\\\") $GN_EXTRA_ARGS\"\nTo build, run ninja with the electron target:\nNota Bene: This will also take a while and probably heat up your lap.\nFor the debug configuration:\n$ ninja -C out/Debug electron\nFor the release configuration:\n$ ninja -C out/Release electron\nThis will build all of what was previously 'libchromiumcontent' (i.e. the\ncontent/ directory of chromium and its dependencies, incl. WebKit and V8),\nso it will take a while.\nTo speed up subsequent builds, you can use sccache. Add the GN arg\ncc_wrapper = \"sccache\" by running gn args out/Debug to bring up an\neditor and adding a line to the end of the file.\nThe built executable will be under ./out/Debug:\n$ ./out/Debug/Electron.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron\n# or, on Windows\n$ ./out/Debug/electron.exe\n# or, on Linux\n$ ./out/Debug/electron\n\n\nPackaging\nOn linux, first strip the debugging and symbol information:\nelectron/script/strip-binaries.py -d out/Release\nTo package the electron build as a distributable zip file:\nninja -C out/Release electron:electron_dist_zip\n\n\nCross-compiling\nTo compile for a platform that isn't the same as the one you're building on,\nset the target_cpu and target_os GN arguments. For example, to compile an\nx86 target from an x64 host, specify target_cpu = \"x86\" in gn args.\n$ gn gen out/Debug-x86 --args='... target_cpu = \"x86\"'\nNot all combinations of source and target CPU/OS are supported by Chromium.\n\nHostTargetStatus\nWindows x64Windows arm64Experimental\nWindows x64Windows x86Automatically tested\nLinux x64Linux x86Automatically tested\n\nIf you test other combinations and find them to work, please update this document :)\nSee the GN reference for allowable values of target_os\nand target_cpu.\n\n\nWindows on Arm (experimental)\nTo cross-compile for Windows on Arm, follow Chromium's guide to get the necessary dependencies, SDK and libraries, then build with ELECTRON_BUILDING_WOA=1 in your environment before running gclient sync.\nset ELECTRON_BUILDING_WOA=1\ngclient sync -f --with_branch_heads --with_tags\nOr (if using PowerShell):\n$env:ELECTRON_BUILDING_WOA=1\ngclient sync -f --with_branch_heads --with_tags\nNext, run gn gen as above with target_cpu=\"arm64\".\n\n\nTests\nTo run the tests, you'll first need to build the test modules against the\nsame version of Node.js that was built as part of the build process. To\ngenerate build headers for the modules to compile against, run the following\nunder src/ directory.\n$ ninja -C out/Debug third_party/electron_node:headers\n# Install the test modules with the generated headers\n$ (cd electron/spec && npm i --nodedir=../../out/Debug/gen/node_headers)\nThen, run Electron with electron/spec as the argument:\n# on Mac:\n$ ./out/Debug/Electron.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron electron/spec\n# on Windows:\n$ ./out/Debug/electron.exe electron/spec\n# on Linux:\n$ ./out/Debug/electron electron/spec\nIf you're debugging something, it can be helpful to pass some extra flags to\nthe Electron binary:\n$ ./out/Debug/Electron.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron electron/spec \\\n  --ci --enable-logging -g 'BrowserWindow module'\n\n\nSharing the git cache between multiple machines\nIt is possible to share the gclient git cache with other machines by exporting it as\nSMB share on linux, but only one process/machine can be using the cache at a\ntime. The locks created by git-cache script will try to prevent this, but it may\nnot work perfectly in a network.\nOn Windows, SMBv2 has a directory cache that will cause problems with the git\ncache script, so it is necessary to disable it by setting the registry key\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Lanmanworkstation\\Parameters\\DirectoryCacheLifetime\nto 0. More information: https://stackoverflow.com/a/9935126\nThis can be set quickly in powershell (ran as administrator):\nNew-ItemProperty -Path \"HKLM:\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Lanmanworkstation\\Parameters\" -Name DirectoryCacheLifetime -Value 0 -PropertyType DWORD -Force\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\nStale locks in the git cache\nIf gclient sync is interrupted while using the git cache, it will leave\nthe cache locked. To remove the lock, pass the --break_repo_locks argument to\ngclient sync.\n\n\nI'm being asked for a username/password for chromium-internal.googlesource.com\nIf you see a prompt for Username for 'https://chrome-internal.googlesource.com': when running gclient sync on Windows, it's probably because the DEPOT_TOOLS_WIN_TOOLCHAIN environment variable is not set to 0. Open Control Panel → System and Security → System → Advanced system settings and add a system variable\nDEPOT_TOOLS_WIN_TOOLCHAIN with value 0.  This tells depot_tools to use\nyour locally installed version of Visual Studio (by default, depot_tools will\ntry to download a Google-internal version that only Googlers have access to).\n",

However, using Visual Studio, GitHub's hosted Electron Symbol Server,\nand the Electron source code, you can enable step-through debugging\nwith breakpoints inside Electron's source code.\nSee also: There's a wealth of information on debugging Chromium, much of which also applies to Electron, on the Chromium developers site: Debugging Chromium on Windows.\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\nA debug build of Electron: The easiest way is usually building it\nyourself, using the tools and prerequisites listed in the\nbuild instructions for Windows. While you can\nattach to and debug Electron as you can download it directly, you will\nfind that it is heavily optimized, making debugging substantially more\ndifficult: The debugger will not be able to show you the content of all\nvariables and the execution path can seem strange because of inlining,\ntail calls, and other compiler optimizations.\n\n\nVisual Studio with C++ Tools: The free community editions of Visual\nStudio 2013 and Visual Studio 2015 both work. Once installed,\nconfigure Visual Studio to use GitHub's Electron Symbol server.\nIt will enable Visual Studio to gain a better understanding of what happens\ninside Electron, making it easier to present variables in a human-readable\nformat.\n\n\nProcMon: The free SysInternals tool allows you to inspect\na processes parameters, file handles, and registry operations.\n\n\n\n\nAttaching to and Debugging Electron\nTo start a debugging session, open up PowerShell/CMD and execute your debug\nbuild of Electron, using the application to open as a parameter.\n$ ./out/Debug/electron.exe ~/my-electron-app/\n\n\nSetting Breakpoints\nThen, open up Visual Studio. Electron is not built with Visual Studio and hence\ndoes not contain a project file - you can however open up the source code files\n\"As File\", meaning that Visual Studio will open them up by themselves. You can\nstill set breakpoints - Visual Studio will automatically figure out that the\nsource code matches the code running in the attached process and break\naccordingly.\nRelevant code files can be found in ./atom/.\n\n\nAttaching\nYou can attach the Visual Studio debugger to a running process on a local or\nremote computer. After the process is running, click Debug / Attach to Process\n(or press CTRL+ALT+P) to open the \"Attach to Process\" dialog box. You can use\nthis capability to debug apps that are running on a local or remote computer,\ndebug multiple processes simultaneously.\nIf Electron is running under a different user account, select the\nShow processes from all users check box. Notice that depending on how many\nBrowserWindows your app opened, you will see multiple processes. A typical\none-window app will result in Visual Studio presenting you with two\nElectron.exe entries - one for the main process and one for the renderer\nprocess. Since the list only gives you names, there's currently no reliable\nway of figuring out which is which.\n\n\nWhich Process Should I Attach to?\nCode executed within the main process (that is, code found in or eventually run\nby your main JavaScript file) as well as code called using the remote\n(require('electron').remote) will run inside the main process, while other\ncode will execute inside its respective renderer process.\nYou can be attached to multiple programs when you are debugging, but only one\nprogram is active in the debugger at any time. You can set the active program\nin the Debug Location toolbar or the Processes window.\n\n\nUsing ProcMon to Observe a Process\nWhile Visual Studio is fantastic for inspecting specific code paths, ProcMon's\nstrength is really in observing everything your application is doing with the\noperating system - it captures File, Registry, Network, Process, and Profiling\ndetails of processes. It attempts to log all events occurring and can be\nquite overwhelming, but if you seek to understand what and how your application\nis doing to the operating system, it can be a valuable resource.\nFor an introduction to ProcMon's basic and advanced debugging features, go check\nout this video tutorial provided by Microsoft.\n",

Set the breakpoint using the breakpoint command, specifying\nfile and line to break on:\n(lldb) breakpoint set --file browser.cc --line 117\nBreakpoint 1: where = Electron Framework`atom::Browser::SetName(std::__1::basic_string<char, std::__1::char_traits<char>, std::__1::allocator<char> > const&) + 20 at browser.cc:118, address = 0x000000000015fdb4\nThen, start Electron:\n(lldb) run\nThe app will immediately be paused, since Electron sets the app's name on launch:\n(lldb) run\nProcess 25244 launched: '/Users/fr/Code/electron/out/Debug/Electron.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron' (x86_64)\nProcess 25244 stopped\n* thread #1: tid = 0x839a4c, 0x0000000100162db4 Electron Framework`atom::Browser::SetName(this=0x0000000108b14f20, name=\"Electron\") + 20 at browser.cc:118, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = breakpoint 1.1\n    frame #0: 0x0000000100162db4 Electron Framework`atom::Browser::SetName(this=0x0000000108b14f20, name=\"Electron\") + 20 at browser.cc:118\n   115 \t}\n   116\n   117 \tvoid Browser::SetName(const std::string& name) {\n-> 118 \t  name_override_ = name;\n   119 \t}\n   120\n   121 \tint Browser::GetBadgeCount() {\n(lldb)\nTo show the arguments and local variables for the current frame, run frame variable (or fr v),\nwhich will show you that the app is currently setting the name to \"Electron\".\n(lldb) frame variable\n(atom::Browser *) this = 0x0000000108b14f20\n(const string &) name = \"Electron\": {\n    [...]\n}\nTo do a source level single step in the currently selected thread, execute step (or s).\nThis would take you into name_override_.empty().

You can also continue until a certain\nline is hit in this thread (thread until 100). This command will run the thread in the current\nframe till it reaches line 100 in this frame or stops if it leaves the current frame.\nNow, if you open up Electron's developer tools and call setName, you will once again hit the\nbreakpoint.\n\n\nFurther Reading\nLLDB is a powerful tool with a great documentation. To learn more about it, consider\nApple's debugging documentation, for instance the LLDB Command Structure Reference\nor the introduction to Using LLDB as a Standalone Debugger.\nYou can also check out LLDB's fantastic manual and tutorial, which\nwill explain more complex debugging scenarios.\n",

To turn your operating\nsystem into an environment capable of building desktop apps with Electron,\nyou will merely need Node.js, npm, a code editor of your choice, and a\nrudimentary understanding of your operating system's command line client.\n\n\nSetting up macOS\n\nElectron supports macOS 10.10 (Yosemite) and up. Apple\ndoes not allow running macOS in virtual machines unless the host computer is\nalready an Apple computer, so if you find yourself in need of a Mac, consider\nusing a cloud service that rents access to Macs (like MacInCloud\nor xcloud).\n\nFirst, install a recent version of Node.js. We recommend that you install\neither the latest LTS or Current version available. Visit\nthe Node.js download page and select the macOS Installer.\nWhile Homebrew is an offered option, but we recommend against it - many tools\nwill be incompatible with the way Homebrew installs Node.js.\nOnce downloaded, execute the installer and let the installation wizard guide\nyou through the installation.\nOnce installed, confirm that everything works as expected. Find the macOS\nTerminal application in your /Applications/Utilities folder (or by\nsearching for the word Terminal in Spotlight). Open up Terminal\nor another command line client of your choice and confirm that both node\nand npm are available:\n# This command should print the version of Node.js\nnode -v\n\n# This command should print the version of npm\nnpm -v\nIf both commands printed a version number, you are all set! Before you get\nstarted, you might want to install a code editor suited\nfor JavaScript development.\n\n\nSetting up Windows\n\nElectron supports Windows 7 and later versions – attempting to develop Electron\napplications on earlier versions of Windows will not work. Microsoft provides\nfree virtual machine images with Windows 10 for developers.\n\nFirst, install a recent version of Node.js. We recommend that you install\neither the latest LTS or Current version available. Visit\nthe Node.js download page and select the Windows Installer.\nOnce downloaded, execute the installer and let the installation wizard guide\nyou through the installation.\nOn the screen that allows you to configure the installation, make sure to\nselect the Node.js runtime, npm package manager, and Add to PATH\noptions.\nOnce installed, confirm that everything works as expected. Find the Windows\nPowerShell by opening the Start Menu and typing PowerShell. Open\nup PowerShell or another command line client of your choice and confirm that\nboth node and npm are available:\n# This command should print the version of Node.js\nnode -v\n\n# This command should print the version of npm\nnpm -v\nIf both commands printed a version number, you are all set! Before you get\nstarted, you might want to install a code editor suited\nfor JavaScript development.\n\n\nSetting up Linux\n\nGenerally speaking, Electron supports Ubuntu 12.04, Fedora 21, Debian 8\nand later.\n\nFirst, install a recent version of Node.js. Depending on your Linux\ndistribution, the installation steps might differ. Assuming that you normally\ninstall software using a package manager like apt or pacman, use the\nofficial Node.js guidance on installing on Linux.\nYou're running Linux, so you likely already know how to operate a command line\nclient. Open up your favorite client and confirm that both node and npm\nare available globally:\n# This command should print the version of Node.js\nnode -v\n\n# This command should print the version of npm\nnpm -v\nIf both commands printed a version number, you are all set! Before you get\nstarted, you might want to install a code editor suited\nfor JavaScript development.\n\n\nA Good Editor\nWe might suggest two free popular editors built in Electron:\nGitHub's Atom and Microsoft's Visual Studio Code. Both of\nthem have excellent JavaScript support.\nIf you are one of the many developers with a strong preference, know that\nvirtually all code editors and IDEs these days support JavaScript.\n",

If you try to add an extension that has already been loaded, this method\nwill not return and instead log a warning to the console.\n\n\nHow to remove a DevTools Extension\nYou can pass the name of the extension to the BrowserWindow.removeDevToolsExtension\nAPI to remove it. The name of the extension is returned by\nBrowserWindow.addDevToolsExtension and you can get the names of all installed\nDevTools Extensions using the BrowserWindow.getDevToolsExtensions API.\n\n\nSupported DevTools Extensions\nElectron only supports a limited set of chrome.* APIs, so some extensions\nusing unsupported chrome.* APIs for chrome extension features may not work.\nFollowing Devtools Extensions are tested and guaranteed to work in Electron:\n\nEmber Inspector\nReact Developer Tools\nBackbone Debugger\njQuery Debugger\nAngularJS Batarang\nVue.js devtools\nCerebral Debugger\nRedux DevTools Extension\nMobX Developer Tools\n\n\n\nWhat should I do if a DevTools Extension is not working?\nFirst please make sure the extension is still being maintained, some extensions\ncan not even work for recent versions of Chrome browser, and we are not able to\ndo anything for them.\nThen file a bug at Electron's issues list, and describe which part of the\nextension is not working as expected.\n",

      "body": "Electron Versioning\n\nA detailed look at our versioning policy and implementation.\n\nAs of version 2.0.0, Electron follows semver. The following command will install the most recent stable build of Electron:\nnpm install --save-dev electron\nTo update an existing project to use the latest stable version:\nnpm install --save-dev electron@latest\n\n\nVersion 1.x\nElectron versions < 2.0 did not conform to the semver spec: major versions corresponded to end-user API changes, minor versions corresponded to Chromium major releases, and patch versions corresponded to new features and bug fixes. While convenient for developers merging features, it creates problems for developers of client-facing applications. The QA testing cycles of major apps like Slack, Stride, Teams, Skype, VS Code, Atom, and Desktop can be lengthy and stability is a highly desired outcome. There is a high risk in adopting new features while trying to absorb bug fixes.\nHere is an example of the 1.x strategy:\n\nAn app developed with 1.8.1 cannot take the 1.8.3 bug fix without either absorbing the 1.8.2 feature, or by backporting the fix and maintaining a new release line.\n\n\nVersion 2.0 and Beyond\nThere are several major changes from our 1.x strategy outlined below. Each change is intended to satisfy the needs and priorities of developers/maintainers and app developers.\n\nStrict use of semver\nIntroduction of semver-compliant -beta tags\nIntroduction of conventional commit messages\nWell-defined stabilization branches\nThe master branch is versionless; only stabilization branches contain version information\n\nWe will cover in detail how git branching works, how npm tagging works, what developers should expect to see, and how one can backport changes.\n\n\nsemver\nFrom 2.0 onward, Electron will follow semver.\nBelow is a table explicitly mapping types of changes to their corresponding category of semver (e.g. Major, Minor, Patch).\n\n\n\nMajor Version Increments\nMinor Version Increments\nPatch Version Increments\n\n\n\n\nElectron breaking API changes\nElectron non-breaking API changes\nElectron bug fixes\n\n\nNode.js major version updates\nNode.js minor version updates\nNode.js patch version updates\n\n\nChromium version updates\n\nfix-related chromium patches\n\n\n\nNote that most Chromium updates will be considered breaking. Fixes that can be backported will likely be cherry-picked as patches.\n\n\nStabilization Branches\nStabilization branches are branches that run parallel to master, taking in only cherry-picked commits that are related to security or stability. These branches are never merged back to master.\n\nStabilization branches are always either major or minor version lines, and named against the following template $MAJOR-$MINOR-x e.g. 2-0-x.\nWe allow for multiple stabilization branches to exist simultaneously, and intend to support at least two in parallel at all times, backporting security fixes as necessary.\n\nOlder lines will not be supported by GitHub, but other groups can take ownership and backport stability and security fixes on their own. We discourage this, but recognize that it makes life easier for many app developers.\n\n\nBeta Releases and Bug Fixes\nDevelopers want to know which releases are safe to use. Even seemingly innocent features can introduce regressions in complex applications. At the same time, locking to a fixed version is dangerous because you’re ignoring security patches and bug fixes that may have come out since your version. Our goal is to allow the following standard semver ranges in package.json :\n\nUse ~2.0.0 to admit only stability or security related fixes to your 2.0.0 release.\nUse ^2.0.0 to admit non-breaking reasonably stable feature work as well as security and bug fixes.\n\nWhat’s important about the second point is that apps using ^ should still be able to expect a reasonable level of stability. To accomplish this, semver allows for a pre-release identifier to indicate a particular version is not yet safe or stable.\nWhatever you choose, you will periodically have to bump the version in your package.json as breaking changes are a fact of Chromium life.\nThe process is as follows:\n\n\nAll new major and minor releases lines begin with a beta series indicated by semver prerelease tags of beta.N, e.g. 2.0.0-beta.1. After the first beta, subsequent beta releases must meet all of the following conditions:\n\nThe change is backwards API-compatible (deprecations are allowed)\nThe risk to meeting our stability timeline must be low.\n\n\nIf allowed changes need to be made once a release is beta, they are applied and the prerelease tag is incremented, e.g. 2.0.0-beta.2.\nIf a particular beta release is generally regarded as stable, it will be re-released as a stable build, changing only the version information. e.g. 2.0.0. After the first stable, all changes must be backwards-compatible bug or security fixes.\nIf future bug fixes or security patches need to be made once a release is stable, they are applied and the patch version is incremented\ne.g. 2.0.1.\n\nSpecifically, the above means:\n\nAdmitting non-breaking-API changes before Week 3 in the beta cycle is okay, even if those changes have the potential to cause moderate side-affects\nAdmitting feature-flagged changes, that do not otherwise alter existing code paths, at most points in the beta cycle is okay. Users can explicitly enable those flags in their apps.\nAdmitting features of any sort after Week 3 in the beta cycle is 👎 without a very good reason.\n\nFor each major and minor bump, you should expect to see something like the following:\n2.0.0-beta.1\n2.0.0-beta.2\n2.0.0-beta.3\n2.0.0\n2.0.1\n2.0.2\nAn example lifecycle in pictures:\n\nA new release branch is created that includes the latest set of features. It is published as 2.0.0-beta.1.\n\nA bug fix comes into master that can be backported to the release branch. The patch is applied, and a new beta is published as 2.0.0-beta.2.\n\nThe beta is considered generally stable and it is published again as a non-beta under 2.0.0.\n\nLater, a zero-day exploit is revealed and a fix is applied to master. We backport the fix to the 2-0-x line and release 2.0.1.\n\n\nA few examples of how various semver ranges will pick up new releases:\n\n\n\nMissing Features: Alphas\nOur strategy has a few tradeoffs, which for now we feel are appropriate. Most importantly that new features in master may take a while before reaching a stable release line. If you want to try a new feature immediately, you will have to build Electron yourself.\nAs a future consideration, we may introduce one or both of the following:\n\nalpha releases that have looser stability constraints to betas; for example it would be allowable to admit new features while a stability channel is in alpha\n\n\n\nFeature Flags\nFeature flags are a common practice in Chromium, and are well-established in the web-development ecosystem. In the context of Electron, a feature flag or soft branch must have the following properties:\n\nit is enabled/disabled either at runtime, or build-time; we do not support the concept of a request-scoped feature flag\nit completely segments new and old code paths; refactoring old code to support a new feature violates the feature-flag contract\nfeature flags are eventually removed after the feature is released\n\n\n\nSemantic Commits\nWe seek to increase clarity at all levels of the update and releases process. Starting with 2.0.0 we will require pull requests adhere to the Conventional Commits spec, which can be summarized as follows:\n\n\nCommits that would result in a semver major bump must start their body with BREAKING CHANGE:.\n\n\nCommits that would result in a semver minor bump must start with feat:.\n\n\nCommits that would result in a semver patch bump must start with fix:.\n\n\nWe allow squashing of commits, provided that the squashed message adheres the the above message format.\n\n\nIt is acceptable for some commits in a pull request to not include a semantic prefix, as long as the pull request title contains a meaningful encompassing semantic message.\n\n\n\n\nVersioned master\n\nThe master branch will always contain the next major version X.0.0-nightly.DATE in its package.json\nRelease branches are never merged back to master\nRelease branches do contain the correct version in their package.json\nAs soon as a release branch is cut for a major, master must be bumped to the next major.  I.e. master is always versioned as the next theoretical release branch\n\n",

      "body": "Electron FAQ\n\n\nWhy am I having trouble installing Electron?\nWhen running npm install electron, some users occasionally encounter\ninstallation errors.\nIn almost all cases, these errors are the result of network problems and not\nactual issues with the electron npm package. Errors like ELIFECYCLE,\nEAI_AGAIN, ECONNRESET, and ETIMEDOUT are all indications of such\nnetwork problems. The best resolution is to try switching networks, or\nwait a bit and try installing again.\nYou can also attempt to download Electron directly from\nelectron/electron/releases\nif installing via npm is failing.\n\n\nWhen will Electron upgrade to latest Chrome?\nThe Chrome version of Electron is usually bumped within one or two weeks after\na new stable Chrome version gets released. This estimate is not guaranteed and\ndepends on the amount of work involved with upgrading.\nOnly the stable channel of Chrome is used. If an important fix is in beta or dev\nchannel, we will back-port it.\nFor more information, please see the security introduction.\n\n\nWhen will Electron upgrade to latest Node.js?\nWhen a new version of Node.js gets released, we usually wait for about a month\nbefore upgrading the one in Electron. So we can avoid getting affected by bugs\nintroduced in new Node.js versions, which happens very often.\nNew features of Node.js are usually brought by V8 upgrades, since Electron is\nusing the V8 shipped by Chrome browser, the shiny new JavaScript feature of a\nnew Node.js version is usually already in Electron.\n\n\nHow to share data between web pages?\nTo share data between web pages (the renderer processes) the simplest way is to\nuse HTML5 APIs which are already available in browsers. Good candidates are\nStorage API, localStorage,\nsessionStorage, and IndexedDB.\nOr you can use the IPC system, which is specific to Electron, to store objects\nin the main process as a global variable, and then to access them from the\nrenderers through the remote property of electron module:\n// In the main process.\nglobal.sharedObject = {\n  someProperty: 'default value'\n}\n// In page 1.\nrequire('electron').remote.getGlobal('sharedObject').someProperty = 'new value'\n// In page 2.\nconsole.log(require('electron').remote.getGlobal('sharedObject').someProperty)\n\n\nMy app's window/tray disappeared after a few minutes.\nThis happens when the variable which is used to store the window/tray gets\ngarbage collected.\nIf you encounter this problem, the following articles may prove helpful:\n\nMemory Management\nVariable Scope\n\nIf you want a quick fix, you can make the variables global by changing your\ncode from this:\nconst { app, Tray } = require('electron')\napp.on('ready', () => {\n  const tray = new Tray('/path/to/icon.png')\n  tray.setTitle('hello world')\n})\nto this:\nconst { app, Tray } = require('electron')\nlet tray = null\napp.on('ready', () => {\n  tray = new Tray('/path/to/icon.png')\n  tray.setTitle('hello world')\n})\n\n\nI can not use jQuery/RequireJS/Meteor/AngularJS in Electron.\nDue to the Node.js integration of Electron, there are some extra symbols\ninserted into the DOM like module, exports, require. This causes problems\nfor some libraries since they want to insert the symbols with the same names.\nTo solve this, you can turn off node integration in Electron:\n// In the main process.\nconst { BrowserWindow } = require('electron')\nlet win = new BrowserWindow({\n  webPreferences: {\n    nodeIntegration: false\n  }\n})\nwin.show()\nBut if you want to keep the abilities of using Node.js and Electron APIs, you\nhave to rename the symbols in the page before including other libraries:\n<head>\n<script>\nwindow.nodeRequire = require;\ndelete window.require;\ndelete window.exports;\ndelete window.module;\n</script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"jquery.js\"></script>\n</head>\n\n\nrequire('electron').xxx is undefined.\nWhen using Electron's built-in module you might encounter an error like this:\n> require('electron').webFrame.setZoomFactor(1.0)\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'setZoomLevel' of undefined\nThis is because you have the npm electron module installed\neither locally or globally, which overrides Electron's built-in module.\nTo verify whether you are using the correct built-in module, you can print the\npath of the electron module:\nconsole.log(require.resolve('electron'))\nand then check if it is in the following form:\n\"/path/to/Electron.app/Contents/Resources/atom.asar/renderer/api/lib/exports/electron.js\"\nIf it is something like node_modules/electron/index.js, then you have to\neither remove the npm electron module, or rename it.\nnpm uninstall electron\nnpm uninstall -g electron\nHowever if you are using the built-in module but still getting this error, it\nis very likely you are using the module in the wrong process. For example\nelectron.app can only be used in the main process, while electron.webFrame\nis only available in renderer processes.\n\n\nThe font looks blurry, what is this and what can I do?\nIf sub-pixel anti-aliasing is deactivated, then fonts on LCD screens can look blurry. Example:\n\nSub-pixel anti-aliasing needs a non-transparent background of the layer containing the font glyphs. (See this issue for more info).\nTo achieve this goal, set the background in the constructor for BrowserWindow:\nconst { BrowserWindow } = require('electron')\nlet win = new BrowserWindow({\n  backgroundColor: '#fff'\n})\nThe effect is visible only on (some?) LCD screens. Even if you don't see a difference, some of your users may. It is best to always set the background this way, unless you have reasons not to do so.\nNotice that just setting the background in the CSS does not have the desired effect.\n",

      "body": "Writing Your First Electron App\nElectron enables you to create desktop applications with pure JavaScript by\nproviding a runtime with rich native (operating system) APIs. You could see it\nas a variant of the Node.js runtime that is focused on desktop applications\ninstead of web servers.\nThis doesn't mean Electron is a JavaScript binding to graphical user interface\n(GUI) libraries. Instead, Electron uses web pages as its GUI, so you could also\nsee it as a minimal Chromium browser, controlled by JavaScript.\nNote: This example is also available as a repository you can\ndownload and run immediately.\nAs far as development is concerned, an Electron application is essentially a\nNode.js application. The starting point is a package.json that is identical\nto that of a Node.js module. A most basic Electron app would have the following\nfolder structure:\nyour-app/\n├── package.json\n├── main.js\n└── index.html\nCreate a new empty folder for your new Electron application. Open up your\ncommand line client and run npm init from that very folder.\nnpm init\nnpm will guide you through creating a basic package.json file. The script\nspecified by the main field is the startup script of your app, which will\nrun the main process. An example of your package.json might look like this:\n{\n  \"name\": \"your-app\",\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n  \"main\": \"main.js\"\n}\nNote: If the main field is not present in package.json, Electron will\nattempt to load an index.js (as Node.js does). If this was actually\na simple Node application, you would add a start script that instructs node\nto execute the current package:\n{\n  \"name\": \"your-app\",\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n  \"main\": \"main.js\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"start\": \"node .\"\n  }\n}\nTurning this Node application into an Electron application is quite simple - we\nmerely replace the node runtime with the electron runtime.\n{\n  \"name\": \"your-app\",\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n  \"main\": \"main.js\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"start\": \"electron .\"\n  }\n}\n\n\nInstalling Electron\nAt this point, you'll need to install electron itself. The recommended way\nof doing so is to install it as a development dependency in your app, which\nallows you to work on multiple apps with different Electron versions. To do so,\nrun the following command from your app's directory:\nnpm install --save-dev electron\nOther means for installing Electron exist. Please consult the\ninstallation guide to learn about use with proxies, mirrors,\nand custom caches.\n\n\nElectron Development in a Nutshell\nElectron apps are developed in JavaScript using the same principles and methods\nfound in Node.js development. All APIs and features found in Electron are\naccessible through the electron module, which can be required like any other\nNode.js module:\nconst electron = require('electron')\nThe electron module exposes features in namespaces. As examples, the lifecycle\nof the application is managed through electron.app, windows can be created\nusing the electron.BrowserWindow class. A simple main.js file might wait\nfor the application to be ready and open a window:\nconst { app, BrowserWindow } = require('electron')\n\nfunction createWindow () {\n  // Create the browser window.\n  let win = new BrowserWindow({\n    width: 800,\n    height: 600,\n    webPreferences: {\n      nodeIntegration: true\n    }\n  })\n\n  // and load the index.html of the app.\n  win.loadFile('index.html')\n}\n\napp.on('ready', createWindow)\nThe main.js should create windows and handle all the system events your\napplication might encounter. A more complete version of the above example\nmight open developer tools, handle the window being closed, or re-create\nwindows on macOS if the user clicks on the app's icon in the dock.\nconst { app, BrowserWindow } = require('electron')\n\n// Keep a global reference of the window object, if you don't, the window will\n// be closed automatically when the JavaScript object is garbage collected.\nlet win\n\nfunction createWindow () {\n  // Create the browser window.\n  win = new BrowserWindow({\n    width: 800,\n    height: 600,\n    webPreferences: {\n      nodeIntegration: true\n    }\n  })\n\n  // and load the index.html of the app.\n  win.loadFile('index.html')\n\n  // Open the DevTools.\n  win.webContents.openDevTools()\n\n  // Emitted when the window is closed.\n  win.on('closed', () => {\n    // Dereference the window object, usually you would store windows\n    // in an array if your app supports multi windows, this is the time\n    // when you should delete the corresponding element.\n    win = null\n  })\n}\n\n// This method will be called when Electron has finished\n// initialization and is ready to create browser windows.\n// Some APIs can only be used after this event occurs.\napp.on('ready', createWindow)\n\n// Quit when all windows are closed.\napp.on('window-all-closed', () => {\n  // On macOS it is common for applications and their menu bar\n  // to stay active until the user quits explicitly with Cmd + Q\n  if (process.platform !== 'darwin') {\n    app.quit()\n  }\n})\n\napp.on('activate', () => {\n  // On macOS it's common to re-create a window in the app when the\n  // dock icon is clicked and there are no other windows open.\n  if (win === null) {\n    createWindow()\n  }\n})\n\n// In this file you can include the rest of your app's specific main process\n// code. You can also put them in separate files and require them here.\nFinally the index.html is the web page you want to show:\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <title>Hello World!</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>Hello World!</h1>\n    We are using node <script>document.write(process.versions.node)</script>,\n    Chrome <script>document.write(process.versions.chrome)</script>,\n    and Electron <script>document.write(process.versions.electron)</script>.\n  </body>\n</html>\n\n\nRunning Your App\nOnce you've created your initial main.js, index.html, and package.json\nfiles, you can try your app by running npm start from your application's\ndirectory.\n\n\nTrying this Example\nClone and run the code in this tutorial by using the\nelectron/electron-quick-start repository.\nNote: Running this requires Git and npm.\n# Clone the repository\n$ git clone https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start\n# Go into the repository\n$ cd electron-quick-start\n# Install dependencies\n$ npm install\n# Run the app\n$ npm start\nFor a list of boilerplates and tools to kick-start your development process,\nsee the Boilerplates and CLIs documentation.\n",

      "body": "Glossary\nThis page defines some terminology that is commonly used in Electron development.\n\n\nASAR\nASAR stands for Atom Shell Archive Format. An asar archive is a simple\ntar-like format that concatenates files into a single file. Electron can read\narbitrary files from it without unpacking the whole file.\nThe ASAR format was created primarily to improve performance on Windows... TODO\n\n\nCRT\nThe C Run-time Library (CRT) is the part of the C++ Standard Library that\nincorporates the ISO C99 standard library. The Visual C++ libraries that\nimplement the CRT support native code development, and both mixed native and\nmanaged code, and pure managed code for .NET development.\n\n\nDMG\nAn Apple Disk Image is a packaging format used by macOS. DMG files are\ncommonly used for distributing application \"installers\". electron-builder\nsupports dmg as a build target.\n\n\nIME\nInput Method Editor. A program that allows users to enter characters and\nsymbols not found on their keyboard. For example, this allows users of Latin\nkeyboards to input Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Indic characters.\n\n\nIDL\nInterface description language. Write function signatures and data types in a format that can be used to generate interfaces in Java, C++, JavaScript, etc.\n\n\nIPC\nIPC stands for Inter-Process Communication. Electron uses IPC to send\nserialized JSON messages between the main and renderer processes.\n\n\nlibchromiumcontent\nA shared library that includes the Chromium Content module and all its\ndependencies (e.g., Blink, V8, etc.). Also referred to as \"libcc\".\n\ngithub.com/electron/libchromiumcontent\n\n\n\nmain process\nThe main process, commonly a file named main.js, is the entry point to every\nElectron app. It controls the life of the app, from open to close. It also\nmanages native elements such as the Menu, Menu Bar, Dock, Tray, etc. The\nmain process is responsible for creating each new renderer process in the app.\nThe full Node API is built in.\nEvery app's main process file is specified in the main property in\npackage.json. This is how electron . knows what file to execute at startup.\nIn Chromium, this process is referred to as the \"browser process\". It is\nrenamed in Electron to avoid confusion with renderer processes.\nSee also: process, renderer process\n\n\nMAS\nAcronym for Apple's Mac App Store. For details on submitting your app to the\nMAS, see the Mac App Store Submission Guide.\n\n\nMojo\nAn IPC system for communicating intra- or inter-process, and that's important because Chrome is keen on being able to split its work into separate processes or not, depending on memory pressures etc.\nSee https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/mojo/README.md\n\n\nnative modules\nNative modules (also called addons in\nNode.js) are modules written in C or C++ that can be loaded into Node.js or\nElectron using the require() function, and used as if they were an\nordinary Node.js module. They are used primarily to provide an interface\nbetween JavaScript running in Node.js and C/C++ libraries.\nNative Node modules are supported by Electron, but since Electron is very\nlikely to use a different V8 version from the Node binary installed in your\nsystem, you have to manually specify the location of Electron’s headers when\nbuilding native modules.\nSee also Using Native Node Modules.\n\n\nNSIS\nNullsoft Scriptable Install System is a script-driven Installer\nauthoring tool for Microsoft Windows. It is released under a combination of\nfree software licenses, and is a widely-used alternative to commercial\nproprietary products like InstallShield. electron-builder supports NSIS\nas a build target.\n\n\nOSR\nOSR (Off-screen rendering) can be used for loading heavy page in\nbackground and then displaying it after (it will be much faster).\nIt allows you to render page without showing it on screen.\n\n\nprocess\nA process is an instance of a computer program that is being executed. Electron\napps that make use of the main and one or many renderer process are\nactually running several programs simultaneously.\nIn Node.js and Electron, each running process has a process object. This\nobject is a global that provides information about, and control over, the\ncurrent process. As a global, it is always available to applications without\nusing require().\nSee also: main process, renderer process\n\n\nrenderer process\nThe renderer process is a browser window in your app. Unlike the main process,\nthere can be multiple of these and each is run in a separate process.\nThey can also be hidden.\nIn normal browsers, web pages usually run in a sandboxed environment and are not\nallowed access to native resources. Electron users, however, have the power to\nuse Node.js APIs in web pages allowing lower level operating system\ninteractions.\nSee also: process, main process\n\n\nSquirrel\nSquirrel is an open-source framework that enables Electron apps to update\nautomatically as new versions are released. See the autoUpdater API for\ninfo about getting started with Squirrel.\n\n\nuserland\nThis term originated in the Unix community, where \"userland\" or \"userspace\"\nreferred to programs that run outside of the operating system kernel. More\nrecently, the term has been popularized in the Node and npm community to\ndistinguish between the features available in \"Node core\" versus packages\npublished to the npm registry by the much larger \"user\" community.\nLike Node, Electron is focused on having a small set of APIs that provide\nall the necessary primitives for developing multi-platform desktop applications.\nThis design philosophy allows Electron to remain a flexible tool without being\noverly prescriptive about how it should be used. Userland enables users to\ncreate and share tools that provide additional functionality on top of what is\navailable in \"core\".\n\n\nV8\nV8 is Google's open source JavaScript engine. It is written in C++ and is\nused in Google Chrome. V8 can run standalone, or can be embedded into any C++ application.\nElectron builds V8 as part of Chromium and then points Node to that V8 when\nbuilding it.\nV8's version numbers always correspond to those of Google Chrome. Chrome 59\nincludes V8 5.9, Chrome 58 includes V8 5.8, etc.\n\ndevelopers.google.com/v8\nnodejs.org/api/v8.html\ndocs/development/v8-development.md\n\n\n\nwebview\nwebview tags are used to embed 'guest' content (such as external web pages) in\nyour Electron app. They are similar to iframes, but differ in that each\nwebview runs in a separate process. It doesn't have the same\npermissions as your web page and all interactions between your app and\nembedded content will be asynchronous. This keeps your app safe from the\nembedded content.\n",

Note that you have to listen to the transactions-updated event as soon as possible in your app.\nconst { inAppPurchase } = require('electron').remote\nconst PRODUCT_IDS = ['id1', 'id2']\n\n// Listen for transactions as soon as possible.\ninAppPurchase.on('transactions-updated', (event, transactions) => {\n  if (!Array.isArray(transactions)) {\n    return\n  }\n\n  // Check each transaction.\n  transactions.forEach(function (transaction) {\n    var payment = transaction.payment\n\n    switch (transaction.transactionState) {\n      case 'purchasing':\n        console.log(`Purchasing ${payment.productIdentifier}...`)\n        break\n      case 'purchased':\n\n        console.log(`${payment.productIdentifier} purchased.`)\n\n        // Get the receipt url.\n        let receiptURL = inAppPurchase.getReceiptURL()\n\n        console.log(`Receipt URL: ${receiptURL}`)\n\n        // Submit the receipt file to the server and check if it is valid.\n        // @see https://developer.apple.com/library/content/releasenotes/General/ValidateAppStoreReceipt/Chapters/ValidateRemotely.html\n        // ...\n        // If the receipt is valid, the product is purchased\n        // ...\n\n        // Finish the transaction.\n        inAppPurchase.finishTransactionByDate(transaction.transactionDate)\n\n        break\n      case 'failed':\n\n        console.log(`Failed to purchase ${payment.productIdentifier}.`)\n\n        // Finish the transaction.\n        inAppPurchase.finishTransactionByDate(transaction.transactionDate)\n\n        break\n      case 'restored':\n\n        console.log(`The purchase of ${payment.productIdentifier} has been restored.`)\n\n        break\n      case 'deferred':\n\n        console.log(`The purchase of ${payment.productIdentifier} has been deferred.`)\n\n        break\n      default:\n        break\n    }\n  })\n})\n\n// Check if the user is allowed to make in-app purchase.\nif (!inAppPurchase.canMakePayments()) {\n  console.log('The user is not allowed to make in-app purchase.')\n}\n\n// Retrieve and display the product descriptions.\ninAppPurchase.getProducts(PRODUCT_IDS).then(products => {\n  // Check the parameters.\n  if (!Array.isArray(products) || products.length <= 0) {\n    console.log('Unable to retrieve the product informations.')\n    return\n  }\n\n  // Display the name and price of each product.\n  products.forEach(product => {\n    console.log(`The price of ${product.localizedTitle} is ${product.formattedPrice}.`)\n  })\n\n  // Ask the user which product he/she wants to purchase.\n  let selectedProduct = products[0]\n  let selectedQuantity = 1\n\n  // Purchase the selected product.\n  inAppPurchase.purchaseProduct(selectedProduct.productIdentifier, selectedQuantity).then(isProductValid => {\n    if (!isProductValid) {\n      console.log('The product is not valid.')\n      return\n    }\n\n    console.log('The payment has been added to the payment queue.')\n  })\n})\n",

      "body": "Installation\nTo install prebuilt Electron binaries, use npm.\nThe preferred method is to install Electron as a development dependency in your\napp:\nnpm install electron --save-dev\nSee the Electron versioning doc for info on how to\nmanage Electron versions in your apps.\n\n\nGlobal Installation\nYou can also install the electron command globally in your $PATH:\nnpm install electron -g\n\n\nCustomization\nIf you want to change the architecture that is downloaded (e.g., ia32 on an\nx64 machine), you can use the --arch flag with npm install or set the\nnpm_config_arch environment variable:\nnpm install --arch=ia32 electron\nIn addition to changing the architecture, you can also specify the platform\n(e.g., win32, linux, etc.) using the --platform flag:\nnpm install --platform=win32 electron\n\n\nProxies\nIf you need to use an HTTP proxy you can set these environment variables.\n\n\nCustom Mirrors and Caches\nDuring installation, the electron module will call out to\nelectron-download to download prebuilt binaries of\nElectron for your platform. It will do so by contacting GitHub's\nrelease download page (https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/tag/v$VERSION,\nwhere $VERSION is the exact version of Electron).\nIf you are unable to access GitHub or you need to provide a custom build, you\ncan do so by either providing a mirror or an existing cache directory.\n\n\nMirror\nYou can use environment variables to override the base URL, the path at which to\nlook for Electron binaries, and the binary filename. The url used by electron-download\nis composed as follows:\nurl = ELECTRON_MIRROR + ELECTRON_CUSTOM_DIR + '/' + ELECTRON_CUSTOM_FILENAME\nFor instance, to use the China mirror:\nELECTRON_MIRROR=\"https://npm.taobao.org/mirrors/electron/\"\n\n\nCache\nAlternatively, you can override the local cache. electron-download will cache\ndownloaded binaries in a local directory to not stress your network. You can use\nthat cache folder to provide custom builds of Electron or to avoid making contact\nwith the network at all.\n\nLinux: $XDG_CACHE_HOME or ~/.cache/electron/\nMacOS: ~/Library/Caches/electron/\nWindows: $LOCALAPPDATA/electron/Cache or ~/AppData/Local/electron/Cache/\n\nOn environments that have been using older versions of Electron, you might find the\ncache also in ~/.electron.\nYou can also override the local cache location by providing a ELECTRON_CACHE\nenvironment variable.\nThe cache contains the version's official zip file as well as a checksum, stored as\na text file. A typical cache might look like this:\n├── electron-v1.7.9-darwin-x64.zip\n├── electron-v1.8.1-darwin-x64.zip\n├── electron-v1.8.2-beta.1-darwin-x64.zip\n├── electron-v1.8.2-beta.2-darwin-x64.zip\n├── electron-v1.8.2-beta.3-darwin-x64.zip\n├── SHASUMS256.txt-1.7.9\n├── SHASUMS256.txt-1.8.1\n├── SHASUMS256.txt-1.8.2-beta.1\n├── SHASUMS256.txt-1.8.2-beta.2\n├── SHASUMS256.txt-1.8.2-beta.3\n\n\nSkip binary download\nWhen installing the electron NPM package, it automatically downloads the electron binary.\nThis can sometimes be unnecessary, e.g. in a CI environment, when testing another component.\nTo prevent the binary from being downloaded when you install all npm dependencies you can set the environment variable ELECTRON_SKIP_BINARY_DOWNLOAD.\nE.g.:\nELECTRON_SKIP_BINARY_DOWNLOAD=1 npm install\n\n\nTroubleshooting\nWhen running npm install electron, some users occasionally encounter\ninstallation errors.\nIn almost all cases, these errors are the result of network problems and not\nactual issues with the electron npm package. Errors like ELIFECYCLE,\nEAI_AGAIN, ECONNRESET, and ETIMEDOUT are all indications of such\nnetwork problems. The best resolution is to try switching networks, or\nwait a bit and try installing again.\nYou can also attempt to download Electron directly from\nelectron/electron/releases\nif installing via npm is failing.\nIf installation fails with an EACCESS error you may need to\nfix your npm permissions.\nIf the above error persists, the unsafe-perm flag may need to be\nset to true:\nsudo npm install electron --unsafe-perm=true\nOn slower networks, it may be advisable to use the --verbose flag in order to\nshow download progress:\nnpm install --verbose electron\nIf you need to force a re-download of the asset and the SHASUM file set the\nforce_no_cache environment variable to true.\n",

Please use the issue tracker for bugs only!\n\n\nSubmitting a Bug Report\nWhen opening a new issue in the electron/electron issue tracker, users\nwill be presented with a template that should be filled in.\n<!--\nThanks for opening an issue! A few things to keep in mind:\n\n- The issue tracker is only for bugs and feature requests.\n- Before reporting a bug, please try reproducing your issue against\n  the latest version of Electron.\n- If you need general advice, join our Slack: http://atom-slack.herokuapp.com\n-->\n\n* Electron version:\n* Operating system:\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n<!-- What do you think should happen? -->\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n<!-- What actually happens? -->\n\n### How to reproduce\n\n<!--\n\nYour best chance of getting this bug looked at quickly is to provide a REPOSITORY that can be cloned and run.\n\nYou can fork https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start and include a link to the branch with your changes.\n\nIf you provide a URL, please list the commands required to clone/setup/run your repo e.g.\n\n  $ git clone $YOUR_URL -b $BRANCH\n  $ npm install\n  $ npm start || electron .\n\n-->\nIf you believe that you have found a bug in Electron, please fill out this\nform to the best of your ability.\nThe two most important pieces of information needed to evaluate the report are\na description of the bug and a simple test case to recreate it. It easier to fix\na bug if it can be reproduced.\nSee How to create a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example.\n\n\nTriaging a Bug Report\nIt's common for open issues to involve discussion. Some contributors may\nhave differing opinions, including whether the behavior is a bug or feature.\nThis discussion is part of the process and should be kept focused, helpful,\nand professional.\nTerse responses that provide neither additional context nor supporting detail\nare not helpful or professional. To many, such responses are annoying and\nunfriendly.\nContributors are encouraged to solve issues collaboratively and help one\nanother make progress. If encounter an issue that you feel is invalid, or\nwhich contains incorrect information, explain why you feel that way with\nadditional supporting context, and be willing to be convinced that you may\nbe wrong. By doing so, we can often reach the correct outcome faster.\n\n\nResolving a Bug Report\nMost issues are resolved by opening a pull request. The process for opening and\nreviewing a pull request is similar to that of opening and triaging issues, but\ncarries with it a necessary review and approval workflow that ensures that the\nproposed changes meet the minimal quality and functional guidelines of the\nElectron project.\n",

This guide provides information on: how to submit your app and the\nlimitations of the MAS build.\nNote: Submitting an app to Mac App Store requires enrolling in the Apple Developer\nProgram, which costs money.\n\n\nHow to Submit Your App\nThe following steps introduce a simple way to submit your app to Mac App Store.\nHowever, these steps do not ensure your app will be approved by Apple; you\nstill need to read Apple's Submitting Your App guide on\nhow to meet the Mac App Store requirements.\n\n\nGet Certificate\nTo submit your app to the Mac App Store, you first must get a certificate from\nApple. You can follow these existing guides on web.\n\n\nGet Team ID\nBefore signing your app, you need to know the Team ID of your account. To locate\nyour Team ID, Sign in to Apple Developer Center,\nand click Membership in the sidebar. Your Team ID appears in the Membership\nInformation section under the team name.\n\n\nSign Your App\nAfter finishing the preparation work, you can package your app by following\nApplication Distribution, and then proceed to\nsigning your app.\nFirst, you have to add a ElectronTeamID key to your app's Info.plist, which\nhas your Team ID as its value:\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n  ...\n  <key>ElectronTeamID</key>\n  <string>TEAM_ID</string>\n</dict>\n</plist>\nThen, you need to prepare three entitlements files.\nchild.plist:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n  <dict>\n    <key>com.apple.security.app-sandbox</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>com.apple.security.inherit</key>\n    <true/>\n  </dict>\n</plist>\nparent.plist:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n  <dict>\n    <key>com.apple.security.app-sandbox</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>com.apple.security.application-groups</key>\n    <array>\n      <string>TEAM_ID.your.bundle.id</string>\n    </array>\n  </dict>\n</plist>\nloginhelper.plist:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n  <dict>\n    <key>com.apple.security.app-sandbox</key>\n    <true/>\n  </dict>\n</plist>\nYou have to replace TEAM_ID with your Team ID, and replace your.bundle.id\nwith the Bundle ID of your app.\nAnd then sign your app with the following script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Name of your app.\nAPP=\"YourApp\"\n# The path of your app to sign.\nAPP_PATH=\"/path/to/YourApp.app\"\n# The path to the location you want to put the signed package.\nRESULT_PATH=\"~/Desktop/$APP.pkg\"\n# The name of certificates you requested.\nAPP_KEY=\"3rd Party Mac Developer Application: Company Name (APPIDENTITY)\"\nINSTALLER_KEY=\"3rd Party Mac Developer Installer: Company Name (APPIDENTITY)\"\n# The path of your plist files.\nCHILD_PLIST=\"/path/to/child.plist\"\nPARENT_PLIST=\"/path/to/parent.plist\"\nLOGINHELPER_PLIST=\"/path/to/loginhelper.plist\"\n\nFRAMEWORKS_PATH=\"$APP_PATH/Contents/Frameworks\"\n\ncodesign -s \"$APP_KEY\" -f --entitlements \"$CHILD_PLIST\" \"$FRAMEWORKS_PATH/Electron Framework.framework/Versions/A/Electron Framework\"\ncodesign -s \"$APP_KEY\" -f --entitlements \"$CHILD_PLIST\" \"$FRAMEWORKS_PATH/Electron Framework.framework/Versions/A/Libraries/libffmpeg.dylib\"\ncodesign -s \"$APP_KEY\" -f --entitlements \"$CHILD_PLIST\" \"$FRAMEWORKS_PATH/Electron Framework.framework/Versions/A/Libraries/libnode.dylib\"\ncodesign -s \"$APP_KEY\" -f --entitlements \"$CHILD_PLIST\" \"$FRAMEWORKS_PATH/Electron Framework.framework\"\ncodesign -s \"$APP_KEY\" -f --entitlements \"$CHILD_PLIST\" \"$FRAMEWORKS_PATH/$APP Helper.app/Contents/MacOS/$APP Helper\"\ncodesign -s \"$APP_KEY\" -f --entitlements \"$CHILD_PLIST\" \"$FRAMEWORKS_PATH/$APP Helper.app/\"\ncodesign -s \"$APP_KEY\" -f --entitlements \"$LOGINHELPER_PLIST\" \"$APP_PATH/Contents/Library/LoginItems/$APP Login Helper.app/Contents/MacOS/$APP Login Helper\"\ncodesign -s \"$APP_KEY\" -f --entitlements \"$LOGINHELPER_PLIST\" \"$APP_PATH/Contents/Library/LoginItems/$APP Login Helper.app/\"\ncodesign -s \"$APP_KEY\" -f --entitlements \"$CHILD_PLIST\" \"$APP_PATH/Contents/MacOS/$APP\"\ncodesign -s \"$APP_KEY\" -f --entitlements \"$PARENT_PLIST\" \"$APP_PATH\"\n\nproductbuild --component \"$APP_PATH\" /Applications --sign \"$INSTALLER_KEY\" \"$RESULT_PATH\"\nIf you are new to app sandboxing under macOS, you should also read through\nApple's Enabling App Sandbox to have a basic idea, then\nadd keys for the permissions needed by your app to the entitlements files.\nApart from manually signing your app, you can also choose to use the\nelectron-osx-sign module to do the job.\n\n\nSign Native Modules\nNative modules used in your app also need to be signed. If using\nelectron-osx-sign, be sure to include the path to the built binaries in the\nargument list:\nelectron-osx-sign YourApp.app YourApp.app/Contents/Resources/app/node_modules/nativemodule/build/release/nativemodule\nAlso note that native modules may have intermediate files produced which should\nnot be included (as they would also need to be signed). If you use\nelectron-packager before version 8.1.0, add\n--ignore=.+\\.o$ to your build step to ignore these files. Versions 8.1.0 and\nlater ignore those files by default.\n\n\nUpload Your App\nAfter signing your app, you can use Application Loader to upload it to iTunes\nConnect for processing, making sure you have created a record\nbefore uploading.\n\n\nSubmit Your App for Review\nAfter these steps, you can submit your app for review.\n\n\nLimitations of MAS Build\nIn order to satisfy all requirements for app sandboxing, the following modules\nhave been disabled in the MAS build:\n\ncrashReporter\nautoUpdater\n\nand the following behaviors have been changed:\n\nVideo capture may not work for some machines.\nCertain accessibility features may not work.\nApps will not be aware of DNS changes.\n\nAlso, due to the usage of app sandboxing, the resources which can be accessed by\nthe app are strictly limited; you can read App Sandboxing for\nmore information.\n\n\nAdditional Entitlements\nDepending on which Electron APIs your app uses, you may need to add additional\nentitlements to your parent.plist file to be able to use these APIs from your\napp's Mac App Store build.\n\n\nNetwork Access\nEnable outgoing network connections to allow your app to connect to a server:\n<key>com.apple.security.network.client</key>\n<true/>\nEnable incoming network connections to allow your app to open a network\nlistening socket:\n<key>com.apple.security.network.server</key>\n<true/>\nSee the Enabling Network Access documentation for more\ndetails.\n\n\ndialog.showOpenDialog\n<key>com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-only</key>\n<true/>\nSee the Enabling User-Selected File Access documentation for\nmore details.\n\n\ndialog.showSaveDialog\n<key>com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-write</key>\n<true/>\nSee the Enabling User-Selected File Access documentation for\nmore details.\n\n\nCryptographic Algorithms Used by Electron\nDepending on the countries in which you are releasing your app, you may be\nrequired to provide information on the cryptographic algorithms used in your\nsoftware. See the encryption export compliance docs for\nmore information.\nElectron uses following cryptographic algorithms:\n\nAES - NIST SP 800-38A, NIST SP 800-38D, RFC 3394\nHMAC - FIPS 198-1\nECDSA - ANS X9.62–2005\nECDH - ANS X9.63–2001\nHKDF - NIST SP 800-56C\nPBKDF2 - RFC 2898\nRSA - RFC 3447\nSHA - FIPS 180-4\nBlowfish - https://www.schneier.com/cryptography/blowfish/\nCAST - RFC 2144, RFC 2612\nDES - FIPS 46-3\nDH - RFC 2631\nDSA - ANSI X9.30\nEC - SEC 1\nIDEA - \"On the Design and Security of Block Ciphers\" book by X.

In order\nfor the isDarkMode and Tray APIs to work correctly in this mode on Catalina you need to either have NSRequiresAquaSystemAppearance set to true in your Info.plist file or be on Electron >=7.0.0.\n\n\nAutomatically updating the native interfaces\n\"Native Interfaces\" include the file picker, window border, dialogs, context menus and more; basically anything where\nthe UI comes from macOS and not your app.  The default behavior as of Electron 7.0.0 is to opt in to this automatic\ntheming from the OS.  If you wish to opt out you must set the NSRequiresAquaSystemAppearance key in the Info.plist file\nto false.  Please note that once Electron starts building against the 10.14 SDK it will not be possible for you to opt\nout of this theming.\n\n\nAutomatically updating your own interfaces\nIf your app has its own dark mode you should toggle it on and off in sync with the system's dark mode setting.

      "body": "Notifications (Windows, Linux, macOS)\nAll three operating systems provide means for applications to send notifications\nto the user. Electron conveniently allows developers to send notifications with\nthe HTML5 Notification API, using\nthe currently running operating system's native notification APIs to display it.\nNote: Since this is an HTML5 API it is only available in the renderer process. If\nyou want to show Notifications in the main process please check out the\nNotification module.\nlet myNotification = new Notification('Title', {\n  body: 'Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit Amet'\n})\n\nmyNotification.onclick = () => {\n  console.log('Notification clicked')\n}\nWhile code and user experience across operating systems are similar, there\nare subtle differences.\n\n\nWindows\n\nOn Windows 10, a shortcut to your app with an Application User\nModel ID must be installed to the Start Menu. This can be overkill during development, so adding node_modules\\electron\\dist\\electron.exe to your Start Menu also does the trick. Navigate to the file in Explorer, right-click and 'Pin to Start Menu'. You will then need to add the line app.setAppUserModelId(process.execPath) to your main process to see notifications.\nOn Windows 8.1 and Windows 8, a shortcut to your app with an Application User\nModel ID must be installed to the Start screen. Note,\nhowever, that it does not need to be pinned to the Start screen.\nOn Windows 7, notifications work via a custom implementation which visually\nresembles the native one on newer systems.\n\nElectron attempts to automate the work around the Application User Model ID. When\nElectron is used together with the installation and update framework Squirrel,\nshortcuts will automatically be set correctly. Furthermore,\nElectron will detect that Squirrel was used and will automatically call\napp.setAppUserModelId() with the correct value. During development, you may have\nto call app.setAppUserModelId() yourself.\nFurthermore, in Windows 8, the maximum length for the notification body is 250\ncharacters, with the Windows team recommending that notifications should be kept\nto 200 characters. That said, that limitation has been removed in Windows 10, with\nthe Windows team asking developers to be reasonable. Attempting to send gigantic\namounts of text to the API (thousands of characters) might result in instability.\n\n\nAdvanced Notifications\nLater versions of Windows allow for advanced notifications, with custom templates,\nimages, and other flexible elements. To send those notifications (from either the\nmain process or the renderer process), use the userland module\nelectron-windows-notifications,\nwhich uses native Node addons to send ToastNotification and TileNotification objects.\nWhile notifications including buttons work with electron-windows-notifications,\nhandling replies requires the use of electron-windows-interactive-notifications, which\nhelps with registering the required COM components and calling your Electron app with\nthe entered user data.\n\n\nQuiet Hours / Presentation Mode\nTo detect whether or not you're allowed to send a notification, use the userland module\nelectron-notification-state.\nThis allows you to determine ahead of time whether or not Windows will silently throw\nthe notification away.\n\n\nmacOS\nNotifications are straight-forward on macOS, but you should be aware of\nApple's Human Interface guidelines regarding notifications.\nNote that notifications are limited to 256 bytes in size and will be truncated\nif you exceed that limit.\n\n\nAdvanced Notifications\nLater versions of macOS allow for notifications with an input field, allowing the user\nto quickly reply to a notification. In order to send notifications with an input field,\nuse the userland module node-mac-notifier.\n\n\nDo not disturb / Session State\nTo detect whether or not you're allowed to send a notification, use the userland module\nelectron-notification-state.\nThis will allow you to detect ahead of time whether or not the notification will be displayed.\n\n\nLinux\nNotifications are sent using libnotify which can show notifications on any\ndesktop environment that follows Desktop Notifications\nSpecification, including Cinnamon, Enlightenment, Unity,\nGNOME, KDE.\n",

It returns true in all other cases.\nSince all other conditions return true, one has to be mindful of getting false positives, as we cannot assume true value necessarily means that Electron can access the internet. Such as in cases where the computer is running a virtualization software that has virtual ethernet adapters that are always “connected.”\nTherefore, if you really want to determine the internet access status of Electron,\nyou should develop additional means for checking.\nExample:\nmain.js\nconst { app, BrowserWindow } = require('electron')\n\nlet onlineStatusWindow\n\napp.on('ready', () => {\n  onlineStatusWindow = new BrowserWindow({ width: 0, height: 0, show: false })\n  onlineStatusWindow.loadURL(`file://${__dirname}/online-status.html`)\n})\nonline-status.html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<body>\n<script>\n  const alertOnlineStatus = () => {\n    window.alert(navigator.onLine ?

These should be branched directly off of the master branch.\n$ git checkout -b my-branch -t upstream/master\n\n\nMaking Changes\n\n\nStep 4: Code\nMost pull requests opened against the electron/electron repository include\nchanges to either the C/C++ code in the atom/ folder,\nthe JavaScript code in the lib/ folder, the documentation in docs/api/\nor tests in the spec/ folder.\nPlease be sure to run npm run lint from time to time on any code changes\nto ensure that they follow the project's code style.\nSee coding style for\nmore information about best practice when modifying code in different parts of\nthe project.\n\n\nStep 5: Commit\nIt is recommended to keep your changes grouped logically within individual\ncommits. Many contributors find it easier to review changes that are split\nacross multiple commits. There is no limit to the number of commits in a\npull request.\n$ git add my/changed/files\n$ git commit\nNote that multiple commits often get squashed when they are landed.\n\n\nCommit message guidelines\nA good commit message should describe what changed and why. The Electron project\nuses semantic commit messages to streamline\nthe release process.\nBefore a pull request can be merged, it must have a pull request title with a semantic prefix.\nExamples of commit messages with semantic prefixes:\n\nfix: don't overwrite prevent_default if default wasn't prevented\nfeat: add app.isPackaged() method\ndocs: app.isDefaultProtocolClient is now available on Linux\n\nCommon prefixes:\n\nfix: A bug fix\nfeat: A new feature\ndocs: Documentation changes\ntest: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests\nbuild: Changes that affect the build system\nci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts\nperf: A code change that improves performance\nrefactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature\nstyle: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (linting)\nvendor: Bumping a dependency like libchromiumcontent or node\n\nOther things to keep in mind when writing a commit message:\n\n\nThe first line should:\n\ncontain a short description of the change (preferably 50 characters or less,\nand no more than 72 characters)\nbe entirely in lowercase with the exception of proper nouns, acronyms, and\nthe words that refer to code, like function/variable names\n\n\nKeep the second line blank.\nWrap all other lines at 72 columns.\n\n\n\nBreaking Changes\nA commit that has the text BREAKING CHANGE: at the beginning of its optional\nbody or footer section introduces a breaking API change (correlating with Major\nin semantic versioning). A breaking change can be part of commits of any type.\ne.g., a fix:, feat: & chore: types would all be valid, in addition to any\nother type.\nSee conventionalcommits.org for more details.\n\n\nStep 6: Rebase\nOnce you have committed your changes, it is a good idea to use git rebase\n(not git merge) to synchronize your work with the main repository.\n$ git fetch upstream\n$ git rebase upstream/master\nThis ensures that your working branch has the latest changes from electron/electron\nmaster.\n\n\nStep 7: Test\nBug fixes and features should always come with tests. A\ntesting guide has been\nprovided to make the process easier. Looking at other tests to see how they\nshould be structured can also help.\nBefore submitting your changes in a pull request, always run the full\ntest suite. To run the tests:\n$ npm run test\nMake sure the linter does not report any issues and that all tests pass.\nPlease do not submit patches that fail either check.\nIf you are updating tests and want to run a single spec to check it:\n$ npm run test -match=menu\nThe above would only run spec modules matching menu, which is useful for\nanyone who's working on tests that would otherwise be at the very end of\nthe testing cycle.\n\n\nStep 8: Push\nOnce your commits are ready to go -- with passing tests and linting --\nbegin the process of opening a pull request by pushing your working branch\nto your fork on GitHub.\n$ git push origin my-branch\n\n\nStep 9: Opening the Pull Request\nFrom within GitHub, opening a new pull request will present you with a template\nthat should be filled out:\n<!--\nThank you for your pull request. Please provide a description above and review\nthe requirements below.\n\nBug fixes and new features should include tests and possibly benchmarks.\n\nContributors guide: https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n-->\n\n\nStep 10: Discuss and update\nYou will probably get feedback or requests for changes to your pull request.\nThis is a big part of the submission process so don't be discouraged! Some\ncontributors may sign off on the pull request right away. Others may have\ndetailed comments or feedback. This is a necessary part of the process\nin order to evaluate whether the changes are correct and necessary.\nTo make changes to an existing pull request, make the changes to your local\nbranch, add a new commit with those changes, and push those to your fork.\nGitHub will automatically update the pull request.\n$ git add my/changed/files\n$ git commit\n$ git push origin my-branch\nThere are a number of more advanced mechanisms for managing commits using\ngit rebase that can be used, but are beyond the scope of this guide.\nFeel free to post a comment in the pull request to ping reviewers if you are\nawaiting an answer on something. If you encounter words or acronyms that\nseem unfamiliar, refer to this\nglossary.\n\n\nApproval and Request Changes Workflow\nAll pull requests require approval from a Code Owner of the area you\nmodified in order to land. Whenever a maintainer reviews a pull request they\nmay request changes. These may be small, such as fixing a typo, or may involve\nsubstantive changes. Such requests are intended to be helpful, but at times\nmay come across as abrupt or unhelpful, especially if they do not include\nconcrete suggestions on how to change them.\nTry not to be discouraged. If you feel that a review is unfair, say so or seek\nthe input of another project contributor. Often such comments are the result of\na reviewer having taken insufficient time to review and are not ill-intended.\nSuch difficulties can often be resolved with a bit of patience. That said,\nreviewers should be expected to provide helpful feeback.\n\n\nStep 11: Landing\nIn order to land, a pull request needs to be reviewed and approved by\nat least one Electron Code Owner and pass CI. After that, if there are no\nobjections from other contributors, the pull request can be merged.\nCongratulations and thanks for your contribution!\n\n\nContinuous Integration Testing\nEvery pull request is tested on the Continuous Integration (CI) system to\nconfirm that it works on Electron's supported platforms.\nIdeally, the pull request will pass (\"be green\") on all of CI's platforms.\nThis means that all tests pass and there are no linting errors. However,\nit is not uncommon for the CI infrastructure itself to fail on specific\nplatforms or for so-called \"flaky\" tests to fail (\"be red\"). Each CI\nfailure must be manually inspected to determine the cause.\nCI starts automatically when you open a pull request, but only\nReleasers\ncan restart a CI run. If you believe CI is giving a false negative,\nask a Releaser to restart the tests.\n",

      "body": "Security, Native Capabilities, and Your Responsibility\nAs web developers, we usually enjoy the strong security net of the browser -\nthe risks associated with the code we write are relatively small. Our websites\nare granted limited powers in a sandbox, and we trust that our users enjoy a\nbrowser built by a large team of engineers that is able to quickly respond to\nnewly discovered security threats.\nWhen working with Electron, it is important to understand that Electron is not\na web browser. It allows you to build feature-rich desktop applications with\nfamiliar web technologies, but your code wields much greater power. JavaScript\ncan access the filesystem, user shell, and more. This allows you to build\nhigh quality native applications, but the inherent security risks scale with\nthe additional powers granted to your code.\nWith that in mind, be aware that displaying arbitrary content from untrusted\nsources poses a severe security risk that Electron is not intended to handle.\nIn fact, the most popular Electron apps (Atom, Slack, Visual Studio Code, etc)\ndisplay primarily local content (or trusted, secure remote content without Node\nintegration) – if your application executes code from an online source, it is\nyour responsibility to ensure that the code is not malicious.\n\n\nReporting Security Issues\nFor information on how to properly disclose an Electron vulnerability,\nsee SECURITY.md\n\n\nChromium Security Issues and Upgrades\nWhile Electron strives to support new versions of Chromium as soon as possible,\ndevelopers should be aware that upgrading is a serious undertaking - involving\nhand-editing dozens or even hundreds of files. Given the resources and\ncontributions available today, Electron will often not be on the very latest\nversion of Chromium, lagging behind by several weeks or a few months.\nWe feel that our current system of updating the Chromium component strikes an\nappropriate balance between the resources we have available and the needs of\nthe majority of applications built on top of the framework. We definitely are\ninterested in hearing more about specific use cases from the people that build\nthings on top of Electron. Pull requests and contributions supporting this\neffort are always very welcome.\n\n\nSecurity Is Everyone's Responsibility\nIt is important to remember that the security of your Electron application is\nthe result of the overall security of the framework foundation\n(Chromium, Node.js), Electron itself, all NPM dependencies and\nyour code. As such, it is your responsibility to follow a few important best\npractices:\n\n\nKeep your application up-to-date with the latest Electron framework release.\nWhen releasing your product, you’re also shipping a bundle composed of Electron,\nChromium shared library and Node.js. Vulnerabilities affecting these components\nmay impact the security of your application. By updating Electron to the latest\nversion, you ensure that critical vulnerabilities (such as nodeIntegration bypasses)\nare already patched and cannot be exploited in your application.\n\n\nEvaluate your dependencies. While NPM provides half a million reusable packages,\nit is your responsibility to choose trusted 3rd-party libraries. If you use outdated\nlibraries affected by known vulnerabilities or rely on poorly maintained code,\nyour application security could be in jeopardy.\n\n\nAdopt secure coding practices. The first line of defense for your application\nis your own code. Common web vulnerabilities, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS),\nhave a higher security impact on Electron applications hence it is highly recommended\nto adopt secure software development best practices and perform security testing.\n\n\n\n\nIsolation For Untrusted Content\nA security issue exists whenever you receive code from an untrusted source (e.g.\na remote server) and execute it locally. As an example, consider a remote\nwebsite being displayed inside a default BrowserWindow. If\nan attacker somehow manages to change said content (either by attacking the\nsource directly, or by sitting between your app and the actual destination), they\nwill be able to execute native code on the user's machine.\n\n⚠️ Under no circumstances should you load and execute remote code with\nNode.js integration enabled. Instead, use only local files (packaged together\nwith your application) to execute Node.js code. To display remote content, use\nthe <webview> tag or BrowserView, make sure\nto disable the nodeIntegration and enable contextIsolation.\n\n\n\nElectron Security Warnings\nFrom Electron 2.0 on, developers will see warnings and recommendations printed\nto the developer console. They only show up when the binary's name is Electron,\nindicating that a developer is currently looking at the console.\nYou can force-enable or force-disable these warnings by setting\nELECTRON_ENABLE_SECURITY_WARNINGS or ELECTRON_DISABLE_SECURITY_WARNINGS on\neither process.env or the window object.\n\n\nChecklist: Security Recommendations\nYou should at least follow these steps to improve the security of your application:\n\nOnly load secure content\nDisable the Node.js integration in all renderers that display remote content\nEnable context isolation in all renderers that display remote content\nUse ses.setPermissionRequestHandler() in all sessions that load remote content\nDo not disable webSecurity\nDefine a Content-Security-Policy and use restrictive rules (i.e. script-src 'self')\nDo not set allowRunningInsecureContent to true\nDo not enable experimental features\nDo not use enableBlinkFeatures\n<webview>: Do not use allowpopups\n<webview>: Verify options and params\nDisable or limit navigation\nDisable or limit creation of new windows\nDo not use openExternal with untrusted content\nDisable the remote module\nFilter the remote module\n\nTo automate the detection of misconfigurations and insecure patterns, it is\npossible to use\nelectronegativity. For\nadditional details on potential weaknesses and implementation bugs when\ndeveloping applications using Electron, please refer to this guide for\ndevelopers and auditors\n\n\n1) Only Load Secure Content\nAny resources not included with your application should be loaded using a\nsecure protocol like HTTPS. In other words, do not use insecure protocols\nlike HTTP. Similarly, we recommend the use of WSS over WS, FTPS over\nFTP, and so on.\n\n\nWhy?\nHTTPS has three main benefits:\n1) It authenticates the remote server, ensuring your app connects to the correct\nhost instead of an impersonator.\n2) It ensures data integrity, asserting that the data was not modified while in\ntransit between your application and the host.\n3) It encrypts the traffic between your user and the destination host, making it\nmore difficult to eavesdrop on the information sent between your app and\nthe host.\n\n\nHow?\n// Bad\nbrowserWindow.loadURL('http://example.com')\n\n// Good\nbrowserWindow.loadURL('https://example.com')\n<!-- Bad -->\n<script crossorigin src=\"http://example.com/react.js\"></script>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"http://example.com/style.css\">\n\n<!-- Good -->\n<script crossorigin src=\"https://example.com/react.js\"></script>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://example.com/style.css\">\n\n\n2) Do not enable Node.js Integration for Remote Content\nThis recommendation is the default behavior in Electron since 5.0.0.\nIt is paramount that you do not enable Node.js integration in any renderer\n(BrowserWindow, BrowserView, or\n<webview>) that loads remote content. The goal is to limit the\npowers you grant to remote content, thus making it dramatically more difficult\nfor an attacker to harm your users should they gain the ability to execute\nJavaScript on your website.\nAfter this, you can grant additional permissions for specific hosts. For example,\nif you are opening a BrowserWindow pointed at `https://example.com/\", you can\ngive that website exactly the abilities it needs, but no more.\n\n\nWhy?\nA cross-site-scripting (XSS) attack is more dangerous if an attacker can jump\nout of the renderer process and execute code on the user's computer.\nCross-site-scripting attacks are fairly common - and while an issue, their\npower is usually limited to messing with the website that they are executed on.\nDisabling Node.js integration helps prevent an XSS from being escalated into a\nso-called \"Remote Code Execution\" (RCE) attack.\n\n\nHow?\n// Bad\nconst mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({\n  webPreferences: {\n    nodeIntegration: true,\n    nodeIntegrationInWorker: true\n  }\n})\n\nmainWindow.loadURL('https://example.com')\n// Good\nconst mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({\n  webPreferences: {\n    preload: path.join(app.getAppPath(), 'preload.js')\n  }\n})\n\nmainWindow.loadURL('https://example.com')\n<!-- Bad -->\n<webview nodeIntegration src=\"page.html\"></webview>\n\n<!-- Good -->\n<webview src=\"page.html\"></webview>\nWhen disabling Node.js integration, you can still expose APIs to your website that\ndo consume Node.js modules or features. Preload scripts continue to have access\nto require and other Node.js features, allowing developers to expose a custom\nAPI to remotely loaded content.\nIn the following example preload script, the later loaded website will have\naccess to a window.readConfig() method, but no Node.js features.\nconst { readFileSync } = require('fs')\n\nwindow.readConfig = function () {\n  const data = readFileSync('./config.json')\n  return data\n}\n\n\n3) Enable Context Isolation for Remote Content\nContext isolation is an Electron feature that allows developers to run code\nin preload scripts and in Electron APIs in a dedicated JavaScript context. In\npractice, that means that global objects like Array.prototype.push or\nJSON.parse cannot be modified by scripts running in the renderer process.\nElectron uses the same technology as Chromium's Content Scripts\nto enable this behavior.\nEven when you use nodeIntegration: false to enforce strong isolation and\nprevent the use of Node primitives, contextIsolation must also be used.\n\n\nWhy?\nContext isolation allows each the scripts on running in the renderer to make\nchanges to its JavaScript environment without worrying about conflicting with\nthe scripts in the Electron API or the preload script.\nWhile still an experimental Electron feature, context isolation adds an\nadditional layer of security. It creates a new JavaScript world for Electron\nAPIs and preload scripts, which mitigates so-called \"Prototype Pollution\" attacks.\nAt the same time, preload scripts still have access to the  document and\nwindow objects. In other words, you're getting a decent return on a likely\nvery small investment.\n\n\nHow?\n// Main process\nconst mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({\n  webPreferences: {\n    contextIsolation: true,\n    preload: path.join(app.getAppPath(), 'preload.js')\n  }\n})\n// Preload script\n\n// Set a variable in the page before it loads\nwebFrame.executeJavaScript('window.foo = \"foo\";')\n\n// The loaded page will not be able to access this, it is only available\n// in this context\nwindow.bar = 'bar'\n\ndocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {\n  // Will log out 'undefined' since window.foo is only available in the main\n  // context\n  console.log(window.foo)\n\n  // Will log out 'bar' since window.bar is available in this context\n  console.log(window.bar)\n})\n\n\n4) Handle Session Permission Requests From Remote Content\nYou may have seen permission requests while using Chrome: They pop up whenever\nthe website attempts to use a feature that the user has to manually approve (\nlike notifications).\nThe API is based on the Chromium permissions API\nand implements the same types of permissions.\n\n\nWhy?\nBy default, Electron will automatically approve all permission requests unless\nthe developer has manually configured a custom handler. While a solid default,\nsecurity-conscious developers might want to assume the very opposite.\n\n\nHow?\nconst { session } = require('electron')\n\nsession\n  .fromPartition('some-partition')\n  .setPermissionRequestHandler((webContents, permission, callback) => {\n    const url = webContents.getURL()\n\n    if (permission === 'notifications') {\n      // Approves the permissions request\n      callback(true)\n    }\n\n    // Verify URL\n    if (!url.startsWith('https://example.com/')) {\n      // Denies the permissions request\n      return callback(false)\n    }\n  })\n\n\n5) Do Not Disable WebSecurity\nRecommendation is Electron's default\nYou may have already guessed that disabling the webSecurity property on a\nrenderer process (BrowserWindow,\nBrowserView, or <webview>) disables crucial\nsecurity features.\nDo not disable webSecurity in production applications.\n\n\nWhy?\nDisabling webSecurity will disable the same-origin policy and set\nallowRunningInsecureContent property to true. In other words, it allows\nthe execution of insecure code from different domains.\n\n\nHow?\n// Bad\nconst mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({\n  webPreferences: {\n    webSecurity: false\n  }\n})\n// Good\nconst mainWindow = new BrowserWindow()\n<!-- Bad -->\n<webview disablewebsecurity src=\"page.html\"></webview>\n\n<!-- Good -->\n<webview src=\"page.html\"></webview>\n\n\n6) Define a Content Security Policy\nA Content Security Policy (CSP) is an additional layer of protection against\ncross-site-scripting attacks and data injection attacks. We recommend that they\nbe enabled by any website you load inside Electron.\n\n\nWhy?\nCSP allows the server serving content to restrict and control the resources\nElectron can load for that given web page. https://example.com should\nbe allowed to load scripts from the origins you defined while scripts from\nhttps://evil.attacker.com should not be allowed to run. Defining a CSP is an\neasy way to improve your application's security.\nThe following CSP will allow Electron to execute scripts from the current\nwebsite and from apis.example.com.\n// Bad\nContent-Security-Policy: '*'\n\n// Good\nContent-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' https://apis.example.com\n\n\nCSP HTTP Header\nElectron respects the Content-Security-Policy HTTP header\nwhich can be set using Electron's\nwebRequest.onHeadersReceived\nhandler:\nconst { session } = require('electron')\n\nsession.defaultSession.webRequest.onHeadersReceived((details, callback) => {\n  callback({\n    responseHeaders: {\n      ...details.responseHeaders,\n      'Content-Security-Policy': ['default-src \\'none\\'']\n    }\n  })\n})\n\n\nCSP Meta Tag\nCSP's preferred delivery mechanism is an HTTP header, however it is not possible\nto use this method when loading a resource using the file:// protocol. It can\nbe useful in some cases, such as using the file:// protocol, to set a policy\non a page directly in the markup using a <meta> tag:\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Security-Policy\" content=\"default-src 'none'\">\n\n\nwebRequest.onHeadersReceived([filter, ]listener)\n\n\n7) Do Not Set allowRunningInsecureContent to true\nRecommendation is Electron's default\nBy default, Electron will not allow websites loaded over HTTPS to load and\nexecute scripts, CSS, or plugins from insecure sources (HTTP). Setting the\nproperty allowRunningInsecureContent to true disables that protection.\nLoading the initial HTML of a website over HTTPS and attempting to load\nsubsequent resources via HTTP is also known as \"mixed content\".\n\n\nWhy?\nLoading content over HTTPS assures the authenticity and integrity\nof the loaded resources while encrypting the traffic itself. See the section on\nonly displaying secure content for more details.\n\n\nHow?\n// Bad\nconst mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({\n  webPreferences: {\n    allowRunningInsecureContent: true\n  }\n})\n// Good\nconst mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({})\n\n\n8) Do Not Enable Experimental Features\nRecommendation is Electron's default\nAdvanced users of Electron can enable experimental Chromium features using the\nexperimentalFeatures property.\n\n\nWhy?\nExperimental features are, as the name suggests, experimental and have not been\nenabled for all Chromium users. Furthermore, their impact on Electron as a whole\nhas likely not been tested.\nLegitimate use cases exist, but unless you know what you are doing, you should\nnot enable this property.\n\n\nHow?\n// Bad\nconst mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({\n  webPreferences: {\n    experimentalFeatures: true\n  }\n})\n// Good\nconst mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({})\n\n\n9) Do Not Use enableBlinkFeatures\nRecommendation is Electron's default\nBlink is the name of the rendering engine behind Chromium. As with\nexperimentalFeatures, the enableBlinkFeatures property allows developers to\nenable features that have been disabled by default.\n\n\nWhy?\nGenerally speaking, there are likely good reasons if a feature was not enabled\nby default. Legitimate use cases for enabling specific features exist. As a\ndeveloper, you should know exactly why you need to enable a feature, what the\nramifications are, and how it impacts the security of your application. Under\nno circumstances should you enable features speculatively.\n\n\nHow?\n// Bad\nconst mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({\n  webPreferences: {\n    enableBlinkFeatures: ['ExecCommandInJavaScript']\n  }\n})\n// Good\nconst mainWindow = new BrowserWindow()\n\n\n10) Do Not Use allowpopups\nRecommendation is Electron's default\nIf you are using <webview>, you might need the pages and scripts\nloaded in your <webview> tag to open new windows. The allowpopups attribute\nenables them to create new BrowserWindows using the\nwindow.open() method. <webview> tags are otherwise not allowed to create new\nwindows.\n\n\nWhy?\nIf you do not need popups, you are better off not allowing the creation of\nnew BrowserWindows by default. This follows the principle\nof minimally required access: Don't let a website create new popups unless\nyou know it needs that feature.\n\n\nHow?\n<!-- Bad -->\n<webview allowpopups src=\"page.html\"></webview>\n\n<!-- Good -->\n<webview src=\"page.html\"></webview>\n\n\n11) Verify WebView Options Before Creation\nA WebView created in a renderer process that does not have Node.js integration\nenabled will not be able to enable integration itself. However, a WebView will\nalways create an independent renderer process with its own webPreferences.\nIt is a good idea to control the creation of new <webview> tags\nfrom the main process and to verify that their webPreferences do not disable\nsecurity features.\n\n\nWhy?\nSince <webview> live in the DOM, they can be created by a script running on your\nwebsite even if Node.js integration is otherwise disabled.\nElectron enables developers to disable various security features that control\na renderer process. In most cases, developers do not need to disable any of\nthose features - and you should therefore not allow different configurations\nfor newly created <webview> tags.\n\n\nHow?\nBefore a <webview> tag is attached, Electron will fire the\nwill-attach-webview event on the hosting webContents. Use the event to\nprevent the creation of webViews with possibly insecure options.\napp.on('web-contents-created', (event, contents) => {\n  contents.on('will-attach-webview', (event, webPreferences, params) => {\n    // Strip away preload scripts if unused or verify their location is legitimate\n    delete webPreferences.preload\n    delete webPreferences.preloadURL\n\n    // Disable Node.js integration\n    webPreferences.nodeIntegration = false\n\n    // Verify URL being loaded\n    if (!params.src.startsWith('https://example.com/')) {\n      event.preventDefault()\n    }\n  })\n})\nAgain, this list merely minimizes the risk, it does not remove it. If your goal\nis to display a website, a browser will be a more secure option.\n\n\n12) Disable or limit navigation\nIf your app has no need to navigate or only needs to navigate to known pages,\nit is a good idea to limit navigation outright to that known scope, disallowing\nany other kinds of navigation.\n\n\nWhy?\nNavigation is a common attack vector. If an attacker can convince your app to\nnavigate away from its current page, they can possibly force your app to open\nweb sites on the Internet. Even if your webContents are configured to be more\nsecure (like having nodeIntegration disabled or contextIsolation enabled),\ngetting your app to open a random web site will make the work of exploiting your\napp a lot easier.\nA common attack pattern is that the attacker convinces your app's users to\ninteract with the app in such a way that it navigates to one of the attacker's\npages. This is usually done via links, plugins, or other user-generated content.\n\n\nHow?\nIf your app has no need for navigation, you can call event.preventDefault()\nin a will-navigate handler. If you know which pages your app\nmight navigate to, check the URL in the event handler and only let navigation\noccur if it matches the URLs you're expecting.\nWe recommend that you use Node's parser for URLs. Simple string comparisons can\nsometimes be fooled - a startsWith('https://example.com') test would let\nhttps://example.com.attacker.com through.\nconst URL = require('url').URL\n\napp.on('web-contents-created', (event, contents) => {\n  contents.on('will-navigate', (event, navigationUrl) => {\n    const parsedUrl = new URL(navigationUrl)\n\n    if (parsedUrl.origin !== 'https://example.com') {\n      event.preventDefault()\n    }\n  })\n})\n\n\n13) Disable or limit creation of new windows\nIf you have a known set of windows, it's a good idea to limit the creation of\nadditional windows in your app.\n\n\nWhy?\nMuch like navigation, the creation of new webContents is a common attack\nvector. Attackers attempt to convince your app to create new windows, frames,\nor other renderer processes with more privileges than they had before; or\nwith pages opened that they couldn't open before.\nIf you have no need to create windows in addition to the ones you know you'll\nneed to create, disabling the creation buys you a little bit of extra\nsecurity at no cost. This is commonly the case for apps that open one\nBrowserWindow and do not need to open an arbitrary number of additional\nwindows at runtime.\n\n\nHow?\nwebContents will emit the new-window event\nbefore creating new windows. That event will be passed, amongst other\nparameters, the url the window was requested to open and the options used to\ncreate it. We recommend that you use the event to scrutinize the creation of\nwindows, limiting it to only what you need.\nconst { shell } = require('electron')\n\napp.on('web-contents-created', (event, contents) => {\n  contents.on('new-window', async (event, navigationUrl) => {\n    // In this example, we'll ask the operating system\n    // to open this event's url in the default browser.\n    event.preventDefault()\n\n    await shell.openExternal(navigationUrl)\n  })\n})\n\n\n14) Do not use openExternal with untrusted content\nShell's openExternal allows opening a given protocol URI with\nthe desktop's native utilities. On macOS, for instance, this function is similar\nto the open terminal command utility and will open the specific application\nbased on the URI and filetype association.\n\n\nWhy?\nImproper use of openExternal can be leveraged to compromise\nthe user's host. When openExternal is used with untrusted content, it can be\nleveraged to execute arbitrary commands.\n\n\nHow?\n//  Bad\nconst { shell } = require('electron')\nshell.openExternal(USER_CONTROLLED_DATA_HERE)\n//  Good\nconst { shell } = require('electron')\nshell.openExternal('https://example.com/index.html')\n\n\n15) Disable the remote module\nThe remote module provides a way for the renderer processes to\naccess APIs normally only available in the main process. Using it, a\nrenderer can invoke methods of a main process object without explicitly sending\ninter-process messages. If your desktop application does not run untrusted\ncontent, this can be a useful way to have your renderer processes access and\nwork with modules that are only available to the main process, such as\nGUI-related modules (dialogs, menus, etc.).\nHowever, if your app can run untrusted content and even if you\nsandbox your renderer processes accordingly, the remote module\nmakes it easy for malicious code to escape the sandbox and have access to\nsystem resources via the higher privileges of the main process. Therefore,\nit should be disabled in such circumstances.\n\n\nWhy?\nremote uses an internal IPC channel to communicate with the main process.\n\"Prototype pollution\" attacks can grant malicious code access to the internal\nIPC channel, which can then be used to escape the sandbox by mimicking remote\nIPC messages and getting access to main process modules running with higher\nprivileges.\nAdditionally, it's possible for preload scripts to accidentally leak modules to a\nsandboxed renderer. Leaking remote arms malicious code with a multitude\nof main process modules with which to perform an attack.\nDisabling the remote module eliminates these attack vectors. Enabling\ncontext isolation also prevents the \"prototype pollution\" attacks from\nsucceeding.\n\n\nHow?\n// Bad if the renderer can run untrusted content\nconst mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({})\n// Good\nconst mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({\n  webPreferences: {\n    enableRemoteModule: false\n  }\n})\n<!-- Bad if the renderer can run untrusted content  -->\n<webview src=\"page.html\"></webview>\n\n<!-- Good -->\n<webview enableremotemodule=\"false\" src=\"page.html\"></webview>\n\n\n16) Filter the remote module\nIf you cannot disable the remote module, you should filter the globals,\nNode, and Electron modules (so-called built-ins) accessible via remote\nthat your application does not require. This can be done by blocking\ncertain modules entirely and by replacing others with proxies that\nexpose only the functionality that your app needs.\n\n\nWhy?\nDue to the system access privileges of the main process, functionality\nprovided by the main process modules may be dangerous in the hands of\nmalicious code running in a compromised renderer process. By limiting\nthe set of accessible modules to the minimum that your app needs and\nfiltering out the others, you reduce the toolset that malicious code\ncan use to attack the system.\nNote that the safest option is to\nfully disable the remote module. If\nyou choose to filter access rather than completely disable the module,\nyou must be very careful to ensure that no escalation of privilege is\npossible through the modules you allow past the filter.\n\n\nHow?\nconst readOnlyFsProxy = require(/* ... */) // exposes only file read functionality\n\nconst allowedModules = new Set(['crypto'])\nconst proxiedModules = new Map(['fs', readOnlyFsProxy])\nconst allowedElectronModules = new Set(['shell'])\nconst allowedGlobals = new Set()\n\napp.on('remote-require', (event, webContents, moduleName) => {\n  if (proxiedModules.has(moduleName)) {\n    event.returnValue = proxiedModules.get(moduleName)\n  }\n  if (!allowedModules.has(moduleName)) {\n    event.preventDefault()\n  }\n})\n\napp.on('remote-get-builtin', (event, webContents, moduleName) => {\n  if (!allowedElectronModules.has(moduleName)) {\n    event.preventDefault()\n  }\n})\n\napp.on('remote-get-global', (event, webContents, globalName) => {\n  if (!allowedGlobals.has(globalName)) {\n    event.preventDefault()\n  }\n})\n\napp.on('remote-get-current-window', (event, webContents) => {\n  event.preventDefault()\n})\n\napp.on('remote-get-current-web-contents', (event, webContents) => {\n  event.preventDefault()\n})\n\napp.on('remote-get-guest-web-contents', (event, webContents, guestWebContents) => {\n  event.preventDefault()\n})\n",

They have information\nabout the functions contained in executables and dynamic libraries and provide\nyou with information to get clean call stacks. A Symbol Server allows the\ndebugger to load the correct symbols, binaries and sources automatically without\nforcing users to download large debugging files. The server functions like\nMicrosoft's symbol server so the\ndocumentation there can be useful.\nNote that because released Electron builds are heavily optimized, debugging is\nnot always easy. The debugger will not be able to show you the content of all\nvariables and the execution path can seem strange because of inlining, tail\ncalls, and other compiler optimizations. The only workaround is to build an\nunoptimized local build.\nThe official symbol server URL for Electron is\nhttps://electron-symbols.githubapp.com.\nYou cannot visit this URL directly, you must add it to the symbol path of your\ndebugging tool. In the examples below, a local cache directory is used to avoid\nrepeatedly fetching the PDB from the server. Replace c:\\code\\symbols with an\nappropriate cache directory on your machine.\n\n\nUsing the Symbol Server in Windbg\nThe Windbg symbol path is configured with a string value delimited with asterisk\ncharacters. To use only the Electron symbol server, add the following entry to\nyour symbol path (Note: you can replace c:\\code\\symbols with any writable\ndirectory on your computer, if you'd prefer a different location for downloaded\nsymbols):\nSRV*c:\\code\\symbols\\*https://electron-symbols.githubapp.com\nSet this string as _NT_SYMBOL_PATH in the environment, using the Windbg menus,\nor by typing the .sympath command. If you would like to get symbols from\nMicrosoft's symbol server as well, you should list that first:\nSRV*c:\\code\\symbols\\*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols;SRV*c:\\code\\symbols\\*https://electron-symbols.githubapp.com\n\n\nUsing the symbol server in Visual Studio\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting: Symbols will not load\nType the following commands in Windbg to print why symbols are not loading:\n> !sym noisy\n> .reload /f electron.exe\n",

      "body": "Snapcraft Guide (Ubuntu Software Center & More)\nThis guide provides information on how to package your Electron application\nfor any Snapcraft environment, including the Ubuntu Software Center.\n\n\nBackground and Requirements\nTogether with the broader Linux community, Canonical aims to fix many of the\ncommon software installation problems with the snapcraft\nproject. Snaps are containerized software packages that include required\ndependencies, auto-update, and work on all major Linux distributions without\nsystem modification.\nThere are three ways to create a .snap file:\n1) Using electron-forge or\nelectron-builder, both tools that come with snap\nsupport out of the box. This is the easiest option.\n2) Using electron-installer-snap, which takes electron-packager's output.\n3) Using an already created .deb package.\nIn all cases, you will need to have the snapcraft tool installed. We\nrecommend building on Ubuntu 16.04 (or the current LTS).\nsnap install snapcraft --classic\nWhile it is possible to install snapcraft on macOS using Homebrew, it\nis not able to build snap packages and is focused on managing packages\nin the store.\n\n\nUsing electron-installer-snap\nThe module works like electron-winstaller and similar\nmodules in that its scope is limited to building snap packages. You can install\nit with:\nnpm install --save-dev electron-installer-snap\n\n\nStep 1: Package Your Electron Application\nPackage the application using electron-packager (or a\nsimilar tool). Make sure to remove node_modules that you don't need in your\nfinal application, since any module you don't actually need will increase\nyour application's size.\nThe output should look roughly like this:\n.\n└── dist\n    └── app-linux-x64\n        ├── LICENSE\n        ├── LICENSES.chromium.html\n        ├── content_shell.pak\n        ├── app\n        ├── icudtl.dat\n        ├── libgcrypt.so.11\n        ├── libnode.so\n        ├── locales\n        ├── natives_blob.bin\n        ├── resources\n        ├── v8_context_snapshot.bin\n        └── version\n\n\nStep 2: Running electron-installer-snap\nFrom a terminal that has snapcraft in its PATH, run electron-installer-snap\nwith the only required parameter --src, which is the location of your packaged\nElectron application created in the first step.\nnpx electron-installer-snap --src=out/myappname-linux-x64\nIf you have an existing build pipeline, you can use electron-installer-snap\nprogrammatically. For more information, see the Snapcraft API docs.\nconst snap = require('electron-installer-snap')\n\nsnap(options)\n  .then(snapPath => console.log(`Created snap at ${snapPath}!`))\n\n\nUsing an Existing Debian Package\nSnapcraft is capable of taking an existing .deb file and turning it into\na .snap file. The creation of a snap is configured using a snapcraft.yaml\nfile that describes the sources, dependencies, description, and other core\nbuilding blocks.\n\n\nStep 1: Create a Debian Package\nIf you do not already have a .deb package, using electron-installer-snap\nmight be an easier path to create snap packages. However, multiple solutions\nfor creating Debian packages exist, including electron-forge,\nelectron-builder or\nelectron-installer-debian.\n\n\nStep 2: Create a snapcraft.yaml\nFor more information on the available configuration options, see the\ndocumentation on the snapcraft syntax.\nLet's look at an example:\nname: myApp\nversion: '2.0.0'\nsummary: A little description for the app.\ndescription: |\n You know what? This app is amazing! It does all the things\n for you. Some say it keeps you young, maybe even happy.\n\ngrade: stable\nconfinement: classic\n\nparts:\n  slack:\n    plugin: dump\n    source: my-deb.deb\n    source-type: deb\n    after:\n      - desktop-gtk3\n    stage-packages:\n      - libasound2\n      - libgconf2-4\n      - libnotify4\n      - libnspr4\n      - libnss3\n      - libpcre3\n      - libpulse0\n      - libxss1\n      - libxtst6\n  electron-launch:\n    plugin: dump\n    source: files/\n    prepare: |\n      chmod +x bin/electron-launch\n\napps:\n  myApp:\n    command: bin/electron-launch $SNAP/usr/lib/myApp/myApp\n    desktop: usr/share/applications/myApp.desktop\n    # Correct the TMPDIR path for Chromium Framework/Electron to ensure\n    # libappindicator has readable resources.\n    environment:\n      TMPDIR: $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR\nAs you can see, the snapcraft.yaml instructs the system to launch a file\ncalled electron-launch. In this example, it passes information on to the\napp's binary:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nexec \"$@\" --executed-from=\"$(pwd)\" --pid=$$ > /dev/null 2>&1 &\nAlternatively, if you're building your snap with strict confinement, you\ncan use the desktop-launch command:\napps:\n  myApp:\n    # Correct the TMPDIR path for Chromium Framework/Electron to ensure\n    # libappindicator has readable resources.\n    command: env TMPDIR=$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR PATH=/usr/local/bin:${PATH} ${SNAP}/bin/desktop-launch $SNAP/myApp/desktop\n    desktop: usr/share/applications/desktop.desktop\n",

For example to implement Pepper API, we need some wiring\nsimilar to what official Chrome does. We could have built the relevant\nsources as a part of libcc but most\noften we don't require all the features (some tend to be proprietary,\nanalytics stuff) so we took parts of the code. These could have easily\nbeen patches in libcc, but at the time when these were written the goal of\nlibcc was to maintain very minimal patches and chromium_src changes tend to be\nbig ones. Also, note that these patches can never be upstreamed unlike other\nlibcc patches we maintain now.\n\n\nStructure of Other Directories\n\nscript - Scripts used for development purpose like building, packaging,\ntesting, etc.\ntools - Helper scripts used by GN files, unlike script, scripts put\nhere should never be invoked by users directly.\nvendor - Source code of third party dependencies, we didn't use\nthird_party as name because it would confuse it with the same directory in\nChromium's source code tree.\nnode_modules - Third party node modules used for building.\nout - Temporary output directory of ninja.\ndist - Temporary directory created by script/create-dist.py script\nwhen creating a distribution.\nexternal_binaries - Downloaded binaries of third-party frameworks which\ndo not support building with gn.\n\n\n\nKeeping Git Submodules Up to Date\nThe Electron repository has a few vendored dependencies, found in the\n/vendor directory. Occasionally you might see a message like this\nwhen running git status:\n$ git status\n\n\tmodified:   vendor/depot_tools (new commits)\n\tmodified:   vendor/boto (new commits)\nTo update these vendored dependencies, run the following command:\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\nIf you find yourself running this command often, you can create an alias for it\nin your ~/.gitconfig file:\n[alias]\n\tsu = submodule update --init --recursive\n",

The oldest supported release line will receive\nonly security fixes directly.\nAll supported release lines will accept external pull requests to backport\nfixes previously merged to master, though this may be on a case-by-case\nbasis for some older supported lines. All contested decisions around release\nline backports will be resolved by the Releases Working Group as an agenda item at their weekly meeting the week the backport PR is raised.\n\n\nCurrently supported versions\n\n5.x\n4.x\n3.x\n\n\n\nEnd-of-life\nWhen a release branch reaches the end of its support cycle, the series\nwill be deprecated in NPM and a final end-of-support release will be\nmade. This release will add a warning to inform that an unsupported\nversion of Electron is in use.\nThese steps are to help app developers learn when a branch they're\nusing becomes unsupported, but without being excessively intrusive\nto end users.\nIf an application has exceptional circumstances and needs to stay\non an unsupported series of Electron, developers can silence the\nend-of-support warning by omitting the final release from the app's\npackage.json devDependencies. For example, since the 1-6-x series\nended with an end-of-support 1.6.18 release, developers could choose\nto stay in the 1-6-x series without warnings with devDependency of\n\"electron\": 1.6.0 - 1.6.17.\n\n\nSupported Platforms\nFollowing platforms are supported by Electron:\n\n\nmacOS\nOnly 64bit binaries are provided for macOS, and the minimum macOS version\nsupported is macOS 10.10 (Yosemite).\n\n\nWindows\nWindows 7 and later are supported, older operating systems are not supported\n(and do not work).\nBoth ia32 (x86) and x64 (amd64) binaries are provided for Windows.\nRunning Electron apps on Windows for ARM devices is possible by using the\nia32 binary.\n\n\nLinux\nThe prebuilt ia32 (i686) and x64 (amd64) binaries of Electron are built on\nUbuntu 12.04, the armv7l binary is built against ARM v7 with hard-float ABI and\nNEON for Debian Wheezy.\nUntil the release of Electron 2.0, Electron will also\ncontinue to release the armv7l binary with a simple arm suffix. Both binaries\nare identical.\nWhether the prebuilt binary can run on a distribution depends on whether the\ndistribution includes the libraries that Electron is linked to on the building\nplatform, so only Ubuntu 12.04 is guaranteed to work, but following platforms\nare also verified to be able to run the prebuilt binaries of Electron:\n\nUbuntu 12.04 and newer\nFedora 21\nDebian 8\n\n",

To learn more about Electron's\ncoding style, please see the coding-style document.\n\n\nLinting\nTo ensure that your JavaScript is in compliance with the Electron coding\nstyle, run npm run lint-js, which will run standard against both\nElectron itself as well as the unit tests. If you are using an editor\nwith a plugin/addon system, you might want to use one of the many\nStandardJS addons to be informed of coding style\nviolations before you ever commit them.\nTo run standard with parameters, run npm run lint-js -- followed by\narguments you want passed to standard.\nTo ensure that your C++ is in compliance with the Electron coding style,\nrun npm run lint-cpp, which runs a cpplint script. We recommend that\nyou use clang-format and prepared a short tutorial.\nThere is not a lot of Python in this repository, but it too is governed\nby coding style rules. npm run lint-py will check all Python, using\npylint to do so.\n\n\nUnit Tests\nTo run all unit tests, run npm run test. The unit tests are an Electron\napp (surprise!) that can be found in the spec folder. Note that it has\nits own package.json and that its dependencies are therefore not defined\nin the top-level package.json.\nTo run only specific tests matching a pattern, run npm run test -- -g=PATTERN, replacing the PATTERN with a regex that matches the tests\nyou would like to run. As an example: If you want to run only IPC tests, you\nwould run npm run test -- -g ipc.\n",

Widevine support is an alternative solution for\nstreaming services that currently rely on Silverlight for playback of\nDRM-protected video content. It will allow websites to show DRM-protected video\ncontent in Firefox without the use of NPAPI plugins. The Widevine CDM runs in an\nopen-source CDM sandbox providing better user security than NPAPI plugins.\n\n\nNote on VMP\nAs of Electron v1.8.0 (Chrome v59),\nthe below steps are may only be some of the necessary steps to enable Widevine;\nany app on or after that version intending to use the Widevine CDM may need to\nbe signed using a license obtained from Widevine\nitself.\nPer Widevine:\n\nChrome 59 (and later) includes support for Verified Media Path (VMP). VMP\nprovides a method to verify the authenticity of a device platform. For browser\ndeployments, this will provide an additional signal to determine if a\nbrowser-based implementation is reliable and secure.\nThe proxy integration guide has been updated with information about VMP and\nhow to issue licenses.\nWidevine recommends our browser-based integrations (vendors and browser-based\napplications) add support for VMP.\n\nTo enable video playback with this new restriction,\ncastLabs has created a\nfork that has implemented the\nnecessary changes to enable Widevine to be played in an Electron application if\none has obtained the necessary licenses from widevine.\n\n\nGetting the library\nOpen chrome://components/ in Chrome browser, find Widevine Content Decryption Module\nand make sure it is up to date, then you can find the library files from the\napplication directory.\n\n\nOn Windows\nThe library file widevinecdm.dll will be under\nProgram Files(x86)/Google/Chrome/Application/CHROME_VERSION/WidevineCdm/_platform_specific/win_(x86|x64)/\ndirectory.\n\n\nOn MacOS\nThe library file libwidevinecdm.dylib will be under\n/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/Versions/CHROME_VERSION/Google Chrome Framework.framework/Versions/A/Libraries/WidevineCdm/_platform_specific/mac_(x86|x64)/\ndirectory.\nNote: Make sure that chrome version used by Electron is greater than or\nequal to the min_chrome_version value of Chrome's widevine cdm component.\nThe value can be found in manifest.json under WidevineCdm directory.\n\n\nUsing the library\nAfter getting the library files, you should pass the path to the file\nwith --widevine-cdm-path command line switch, and the library's version\nwith --widevine-cdm-version switch. The command line switches have to be\npassed before the ready event of app module gets emitted.\nExample code:\nconst { app, BrowserWindow } = require('electron')\n\n// You have to pass the directory that contains widevine library here, it is\n// * `libwidevinecdm.dylib` on macOS,\n// * `widevinecdm.dll` on Windows.\napp.commandLine.appendSwitch('widevine-cdm-path', '/path/to/widevine_library')\n// The version of plugin can be got from `chrome://components` page in Chrome.\napp.commandLine.appendSwitch('widevine-cdm-version', '1.4.8.866')\n\nlet win = null\napp.on('ready', () => {\n  win = new BrowserWindow()\n  win.show()\n})\n\n\nVerifying Widevine CDM support\nTo verify whether widevine works, you can use following ways:\n\nOpen https://shaka-player-demo.appspot.com/ and load a manifest that uses\nWidevine.\nOpen http://www.dash-player.com/demo/drm-test-area/, check whether the page\nsays bitdash uses Widevine in your browser, then play the video.\n\n",

      "body": "Updating Applications\nThere are several ways to update an Electron application. The easiest and\nofficially supported one is taking advantage of the built-in\nSquirrel framework and\nElectron's autoUpdater module.\n\n\nUsing update.electronjs.org\nGitHub's Electron team maintains update.electronjs.org, a free and open-source\nwebservice that Electron apps can use to self-update. The service is designed\nfor Electron apps that meet the following criteria:\n\nApp runs on macOS or Windows\nApp has a public GitHub repository\nBuilds are published to GitHub Releases\nBuilds are code-signed\n\nThe easiest way to use this service is by installing update-electron-app,\na Node.js module preconfigured for use with update.electronjs.org.\nInstall the module:\nnpm install update-electron-app\nInvoke the updater from your app's main process file:\nrequire('update-electron-app')()\nBy default, this module will check for updates at app startup, then every ten\nminutes. When an update is found, it will automatically be downloaded in the background. When the download completes, a dialog is displayed allowing the user\nto restart the app.\nIf you need to customize your configuration, you can\npass options to update-electron-app\nor\nuse the update service directly.\n\n\nUsing electron-builder\nIf your app is packaged with electron-builder you can use the\nelectron-updater module, which does not require a server and allows for updates\nfrom S3, GitHub or any other static file host. This sidesteps Electron's built-in\nupdate mechanism, meaning that the rest of this documentation will not apply to\nelectron-builder's updater.\n\n\nDeploying an Update Server\nIf you're developing a private Electron application, or if you're not\npublishing releases to GitHub Releases, it may be necessary to run your own\nupdate server.\nDepending on your needs, you can choose from one of these:\n\nHazel – Update server for private or open-source apps which can be\ndeployed for free on Now. It pulls from GitHub Releases\nand leverages the power of GitHub's CDN.\nNuts – Also uses GitHub Releases, but caches app\nupdates on disk and supports private repositories.\nelectron-release-server – Provides a dashboard for\nhandling releases and does not require releases to originate on GitHub.\nNucleus – A complete update server for Electron apps maintained by\nAtlassian. Supports multiple applications and channels; uses a static file store\nto minify server cost.\n\n\n\nImplementing Updates in Your App\nOnce you've deployed your update server, continue with importing the required\nmodules in your code. The following code might vary for different server\nsoftware, but it works like described when using\nHazel.\nImportant: Please ensure that the code below will only be executed in\nyour packaged app, and not in development. You can use\nelectron-is-dev to check for\nthe environment.\nconst { app, autoUpdater, dialog } = require('electron')\nNext, construct the URL of the update server and tell\nautoUpdater about it:\nconst server = 'https://your-deployment-url.com'\nconst feed = `${server}/update/${process.platform}/${app.getVersion()}`\n\nautoUpdater.setFeedURL(feed)\nAs the final step, check for updates. The example below will check every minute:\nsetInterval(() => {\n  autoUpdater.checkForUpdates()\n}, 60000)\nOnce your application is packaged,\nit will receive an update for each new\nGitHub Release that you\npublish.\n\n\nApplying Updates\nNow that you've configured the basic update mechanism for your application, you\nneed to ensure that the user will get notified when there's an update. This\ncan be achieved using the autoUpdater API\nevents:\nautoUpdater.on('update-downloaded', (event, releaseNotes, releaseName) => {\n  const dialogOpts = {\n    type: 'info',\n    buttons: ['Restart', 'Later'],\n    title: 'Application Update',\n    message: process.platform === 'win32' ? releaseNotes : releaseName,\n    detail: 'A new version has been downloaded. Restart the application to apply the updates.'\n  }\n\n  dialog.showMessageBox(dialogOpts, (response) => {\n    if (response === 0) autoUpdater.quitAndInstall()\n  })\n})\nAlso make sure that errors are\nbeing handled. Here's an example\nfor logging them to stderr:\nautoUpdater.on('error', message => {\n  console.error('There was a problem updating the application')\n  console.error(message)\n})\n",

Once an upstream Node\nrelease is chosen, it's placed in a branch in Electron's Node fork\nand any Electron Node patches are applied there.\nAnother factor is that the Node project patches its version of V8.\nAs mentioned above, Electron builds everything with a single copy\nof V8, so Node's V8 patches must be ported to that copy.\nOnce all of Electron's dependencies are building and using the same\ncopy of V8, the next step is to fix any Electron code issues caused\nby the Node upgrade.\n[FIXME] something about a Node debugger in Atom that we (e.g. deepak)\nuse and need to confirm doesn't break with the Node upgrade?\nSo in short, the primary steps are:\n\nUpdate Electron's Node fork to the desired version\nBackport Node's V8 patches to our copy of V8\nUpdate the GN build files, porting changes from node's GYP files\nUpdate Electron's DEPS to use new version of Node\n\n\n\nUpdating Electron's Node fork\n\nEnsure that master on electron/node has updated release tags from nodejs/node\nCreate a branch in https://github.com/electron/node: electron-node-vX.X.X where the base that you're branching from is the tag for the desired update\n\n\nvX.X.X Must use a version of Node compatible with our current version of Chromium\n\n\nRe-apply our commits from the previous version of Node we were using (vY.Y.Y) to v.X.X.X\n\n\nCheck release tag and select the range of commits we need to re-apply\n\nCherry-pick commit range:\n\nCheckout both vY.Y.Y & v.X.X.X\ngit cherry-pick FIRST_COMMIT_HASH..LAST_COMMIT_HASH\n\n\n\nResolve merge conflicts in each file encountered, then:\n\ngit add <conflict-file>\ngit cherry-pick --continue\nRepeat until finished\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating V8 Patches\nWe need to generate a patch file from each patch that Node\napplies to V8.\n$ cd third_party/electron_node\n$ CURRENT_NODE_VERSION=vX.Y.Z\n# Find the last commit with the message \"deps: update V8 to <some version>\"\n# This commit corresponds to Node resetting V8 to its pristine upstream\n# state at the stated version.\n$ LAST_V8_UPDATE=\"$(git log --grep='^deps: update V8' --format='%H' -1 deps/v8)\"\n# This creates a patch file containing all changes in deps/v8 from\n# $LAST_V8_UPDATE up to the current Node version, formatted in a way that\n# it will apply cleanly to the V8 repository (i.e. with `deps/v8`\n# stripped off the path and excluding the v8/gypfiles directory, which\n# isn't present in V8.\n$ git format-patch \\\n    --relative=deps/v8 \\\n    $LAST_V8_UPDATE..$CURRENT_NODE_VERSION \\\n    deps/v8 \\\n    ':(exclude)deps/v8/gypfiles' \\\n    --stdout \\\n    > ../../electron/common/patches/v8/node_v8_patches.patch\nThis list of patches will probably include one that claims to\nmake the V8 API backwards-compatible with a previous version of\nV8. Unfortunately, those patches almost always change the V8 API\nin a way that is incompatible with Chromium.\nIt's usually easier to update Node to work without the\ncompatibility patch than to update Chromium to work with the\ncompatibility patch, so it's recommended to revert the\ncompatibility patch and fix any errors that arise when compiling\nNode.\n\n\nUpdate Electron's DEPS file\nUpdate the DEPS file in the root of\nelectron/electron to\npoint to the git hash of the updated Node.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nNode maintains its own fork of V8\n\nThey backport a small amount of things as needed\nDocumentation in Node about how they work with V8\n\n\n\nWe update code such that we only use one copy of V8 across all of Electron\n\nE.g Electron, Chromium, and Node.js\n\n\n\nWe don’t track upstream closely due to logistics:\n\nUpstream uses multiple repos and so merging into a single repo\nwould result in lost history. So we only update when we’re planning\na Node version bump in Electron.\n\n\n\nChromium is large and time-consuming to update, so we typically\nchoose the Node version based on which of its releases has a version\nof V8 that’s closest to the version in Chromium that we’re using.\n\nWe sometimes have to wait for the next periodic Node release\nbecause it will sync more closely with the version of V8 in the new Chromium\n\n\n\nElectron keeps all its patches in the repo because it’s simpler than\nmaintaining different repos for patches for each upstream project.\n\nCrashpad, Node.js, Chromium, Skia etc. patches are all kept in the same place\n\n\n\nBuilding Node:\n\nWe maintain our own GN build files for Node.js to make it easier to ensure\nthat eevrything is built with the same compiler flags.\nThis means that every time we upgrade Node.js we have to do a modest amount of\nwork to synchronize the GN files with the upstream GYP files.\n\n\n\n",

      "body": "Using Native Node Modules\nNative Node modules are supported by Electron, but since Electron is very\nlikely to use a different V8 version from the Node binary installed on your\nsystem, the modules you use will need to be recompiled for Electron. Otherwise,\nyou will get the following class of error when you try to run your app:\nError: The module '/path/to/native/module.node'\nwas compiled against a different Node.js version using\nNODE_MODULE_VERSION $XYZ. This version of Node.js requires\nNODE_MODULE_VERSION $ABC. Please try re-compiling or re-installing\nthe module (for instance, using `npm rebuild` or `npm install`).\n\n\nHow to install native modules\nThere are several different ways to install native modules:\n\n\nInstalling modules and rebuilding for Electron\nYou can install modules like other Node projects, and then rebuild the modules\nfor Electron with the electron-rebuild package. This\nmodule can automatically determine the version of Electron and handle the\nmanual steps of downloading headers and rebuilding native modules for your app.\nFor example, to install electron-rebuild and then rebuild modules with it\nvia the command line:\nnpm install --save-dev electron-rebuild\n\n# Every time you run \"npm install\", run this:\n./node_modules/.bin/electron-rebuild\n\n# On Windows if you have trouble, try:\n.\\node_modules\\.bin\\electron-rebuild.cmd\nFor more information on usage and integration with other tools, consult the\nproject's README.\n\n\nUsing npm\nBy setting a few environment variables, you can use npm to install modules\ndirectly.\nFor example, to install all dependencies for Electron:\n# Electron's version.\nexport npm_config_target=1.2.3\n# The architecture of Electron, see https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/support#supported-platforms\n# for supported architectures.\nexport npm_config_arch=x64\nexport npm_config_target_arch=x64\n# Download headers for Electron.\nexport npm_config_disturl=https://electronjs.org/headers\n# Tell node-pre-gyp that we are building for Electron.\nexport npm_config_runtime=electron\n# Tell node-pre-gyp to build module from source code.\nexport npm_config_build_from_source=true\n# Install all dependencies, and store cache to ~/.electron-gyp.\nHOME=~/.electron-gyp npm install\n\n\nManually building for Electron\nIf you are a developer developing a native module and want to test it against\nElectron, you might want to rebuild the module for Electron manually. You can\nuse node-gyp directly to build for Electron:\ncd /path-to-module/\nHOME=~/.electron-gyp node-gyp rebuild --target=1.2.3 --arch=x64 --dist-url=https://electronjs.org/headers\n\nHOME=~/.electron-gyp changes where to find development headers.\n--target=1.2.3 is the version of Electron.\n--dist-url=... specifies where to download the headers.\n--arch=x64 says the module is built for a 64-bit system.\n\n\n\nManually building for a custom build of Electron\nTo compile native Node modules against a custom build of Electron that doesn't\nmatch a public release, instruct npm to use the version of Node you have bundled\nwith your custom build.\nnpm rebuild --nodedir=/path/to/electron/vendor/node\n\n\nTroubleshooting\nIf you installed a native module and found it was not working, you need to check\nthe following things:\n\nWhen in doubt, run electron-rebuild first.\nMake sure the native module is compatible with the target platform and\narchitecture for your Electron app.\nMake sure win_delay_load_hook is not set to false in the module's binding.gyp.\nAfter you upgrade Electron, you usually need to rebuild the modules.\n\n\n\nA note about win_delay_load_hook\nOn Windows, by default, node-gyp links native modules against node.dll.\nHowever, in Electron 4.x and higher, the symbols needed by native modules are\nexported by electron.exe, and there is no node.dll. In order to load native\nmodules on Windows, node-gyp installs a delay-load\nhook that triggers\nwhen the native module is loaded, and redirects the node.dll reference to use\nthe loading executable instead of looking for node.dll in the library search\npath (which would turn up nothing). As such, on Electron 4.x and higher,\n'win_delay_load_hook': 'true' is required to load native modules.\nIf you get an error like Module did not self-register, or The specified procedure could not be found, it may mean that the module you're trying to use\ndid not correctly include the delay-load hook.  If the module is built with\nnode-gyp, ensure that the win_delay_load_hook variable is set to true in\nthe binding.gyp file, and isn't getting overridden anywhere.  If the module\nis built with another system, you'll need to ensure that you build with a\ndelay-load hook installed in the main .node file. Your link.exe invocation\nshould look like this:\n link.exe /OUT:\"foo.node\" \"...\\node.lib\" delayimp.lib /DELAYLOAD:node.exe /DLL\n     \"my_addon.obj\" \"win_delay_load_hook.obj\"\nIn particular, it's important that:\n\nyou link against node.lib from Electron and not Node. If you link against\nthe wrong node.lib you will get load-time errors when you require the\nmodule in Electron.\nyou include the flag /DELAYLOAD:node.exe. If the node.exe link is not\ndelayed, then the delay-load hook won't get a chance to fire and the node\nsymbols won't be correctly resolved.\nwin_delay_load_hook.obj is linked directly into the final DLL. If the hook\nis set up in a dependent DLL, it won't fire at the right time.\n\nSee node-gyp\nfor an example delay-load hook if you're implementing your own.\n\n\nModules that rely on prebuild\nprebuild provides a way to publish\nnative Node modules with prebuilt binaries for multiple versions of Node\nand Electron.\nIf modules provide binaries for the usage in Electron, make sure to omit\n--build-from-source and the npm_config_build_from_source environment\nvariable in order to take full advantage of the prebuilt binaries.\n\n\nModules that rely on node-pre-gyp\nThe node-pre-gyp tool provides a way to deploy native Node\nmodules with prebuilt binaries, and many popular modules are using it.\nUsually those modules work fine under Electron, but sometimes when Electron uses\na newer version of V8 than Node and/or there are ABI changes, bad things may\nhappen. So in general, it is recommended to always build native modules from\nsource code. electron-rebuild handles this for you automatically.\nIf you are following the npm way of installing modules, then this is done\nby default, if not, you have to pass --build-from-source to npm, or set the\nnpm_config_build_from_source environment variable.\n",

To use the Pepper Flash plugin in\nElectron, you should manually specify the location of the Pepper Flash plugin\nand then enable it in your application.\n\n\nPrepare a Copy of Flash Plugin\nOn macOS and Linux, the details of the Pepper Flash plugin can be found by\nnavigating to chrome://flash in the Chrome browser. Its location and version\nare useful for Electron's Pepper Flash support. You can also copy it to another\nlocation.\n\n\nAdd Electron Switch\nYou can directly add --ppapi-flash-path and --ppapi-flash-version to the\nElectron command line or by using the app.commandLine.appendSwitch method\nbefore the app ready event. Also, turn on plugins option of BrowserWindow.\nFor example:\nconst { app, BrowserWindow } = require('electron')\nconst path = require('path')\n\n// Specify flash path, supposing it is placed in the same directory with main.js.\nlet pluginName\nswitch (process.platform) {\n  case 'win32':\n    pluginName = 'pepflashplayer.dll'\n    break\n  case 'darwin':\n    pluginName = 'PepperFlashPlayer.plugin'\n    break\n  case 'linux':\n    pluginName = 'libpepflashplayer.so'\n    break\n}\napp.commandLine.appendSwitch('ppapi-flash-path', path.join(__dirname, pluginName))\n\n// Optional: Specify flash version, for example, v17.0.0.169\napp.commandLine.appendSwitch('ppapi-flash-version', '17.0.0.169')\n\napp.on('ready', () => {\n  let win = new BrowserWindow({\n    width: 800,\n    height: 600,\n    webPreferences: {\n      plugins: true\n    }\n  })\n  win.loadURL(`file://${__dirname}/index.html`)\n  // Something else\n})\nYou can also try loading the system wide Pepper Flash plugin instead of shipping\nthe plugins yourself, its path can be received by calling\napp.getPath('pepperFlashSystemPlugin').\n\n\nEnable Flash Plugin in a <webview> Tag\nAdd plugins attribute to <webview> tag.\n<webview src=\"https://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/\" plugins></webview>\n\n\nTroubleshooting\nYou can check if Pepper Flash plugin was loaded by inspecting\nnavigator.plugins in the console of devtools (although you can't know if the\nplugin's path is correct).\nThe architecture of Pepper Flash plugin has to match Electron's one. On Windows,\na common error is to use 32bit version of Flash plugin against 64bit version of\nElectron.\nOn Windows the path passed to --ppapi-flash-path has to use \\ as path\ndelimiter, using POSIX-style paths will not work.\nFor some operations, such as streaming media using RTMP, it is necessary to grant wider permissions to players’ .swf files. One way of accomplishing this, is to use nw-flash-trust.\n",

      "body": "Windows Store Guide\nWith Windows 10, the good old win32 executable got a new sibling: The Universal\nWindows Platform. The new .appx format does not only enable a number of new\npowerful APIs like Cortana or Push Notifications, but through the Windows Store,\nalso simplifies installation and updating.\nMicrosoft developed a tool that compiles Electron apps as .appx packages,\nenabling developers to use some of the goodies found in the new application\nmodel. This guide explains how to use it - and what the capabilities and\nlimitations of an Electron AppX package are.\n\n\nBackground and Requirements\nWindows 10 \"Anniversary Update\" is able to run win32 .exe binaries by\nlaunching them together with a virtualized filesystem and registry. Both are\ncreated during compilation by running app and installer inside a Windows\nContainer, allowing Windows to identify exactly which modifications to the\noperating system are done during installation. Pairing the executable with a\nvirtual filesystem and a virtual registry allows Windows to enable one-click\ninstallation and uninstallation.\nIn addition, the exe is launched inside the appx model - meaning that it can use\nmany of the APIs available to the Universal Windows Platform. To gain even more\ncapabilities, an Electron app can pair up with an invisible UWP background task\nlaunched together with the exe - sort of launched as a sidekick to run tasks\nin the background, receive push notifications, or to communicate with other UWP\napplications.\nTo compile any existing Electron app, ensure that you have the following\nrequirements:\n\nWindows 10 with Anniversary Update (released August 2nd, 2016)\nThe Windows 10 SDK, downloadable here\nAt least Node 4 (to check, run node -v)\n\nThen, go and install the electron-windows-store CLI:\nnpm install -g electron-windows-store\n\n\nStep 1: Package Your Electron Application\nPackage the application using electron-packager (or a similar tool).\nMake sure to remove node_modules that you don't need in your final application, since\nany module you don't actually need will increase your application's size.\nThe output should look roughly like this:\n├── Ghost.exe\n├── LICENSE\n├── content_resources_200_percent.pak\n├── content_shell.pak\n├── d3dcompiler_47.dll\n├── ffmpeg.dll\n├── icudtl.dat\n├── libEGL.dll\n├── libGLESv2.dll\n├── locales\n│   ├── am.pak\n│   ├── ar.pak\n│   ├── [...]\n├── natives_blob.bin\n├── node.dll\n├── resources\n│   ├── app\n│   └── atom.asar\n├── v8_context_snapshot.bin\n├── squirrel.exe\n└── ui_resources_200_percent.pak\n\n\nStep 2: Running electron-windows-store\nFrom an elevated PowerShell (run it \"as Administrator\"), run\nelectron-windows-store with the required parameters, passing both the input\nand output directories, the app's name and version, and confirmation that\nnode_modules should be flattened.\nelectron-windows-store `\n    --input-directory C:\\myelectronapp `\n    --output-directory C:\\output\\myelectronapp `\n    --package-version 1.0.0.0 `\n    --package-name myelectronapp\nOnce executed, the tool goes to work: It accepts your Electron app as an input,\nflattening the node_modules. Then, it archives your application as app.zip.\nUsing an installer and a Windows Container, the tool creates an \"expanded\" AppX\npackage - including the Windows Application Manifest (AppXManifest.xml) as\nwell as the virtual file system and the virtual registry inside your output\nfolder.\nOnce the expanded AppX files are created, the tool uses the Windows App Packager\n(MakeAppx.exe) to create a single-file AppX package from those files on disk.\nFinally, the tool can be used to create a trusted certificate on your computer\nto sign the new AppX package. With the signed AppX package, the CLI can also\nautomatically install the package on your machine.\n\n\nStep 3: Using the AppX Package\nIn order to run your package, your users will need Windows 10 with the so-called\n\"Anniversary Update\" - details on how to update Windows can be found here.\nIn opposition to traditional UWP apps, packaged apps currently need to undergo a\nmanual verification process, for which you can apply here.\nIn the meantime, all users will be able to install your package by double-clicking it,\nso a submission to the store might not be necessary if you're looking for an\neasier installation method. In managed environments (usually enterprises), the\nAdd-AppxPackage PowerShell Cmdlet can be used to install it in an automated fashion.\nAnother important limitation is that the compiled AppX package still contains a\nwin32 executable - and will therefore not run on Xbox, HoloLens, or Phones.\n\n\nOptional: Add UWP Features using a BackgroundTask\nYou can pair your Electron app up with an invisible UWP background task that\ngets to make full use of Windows 10 features - like push notifications,\nCortana integration, or live tiles.\nTo check out how an Electron app that uses a background task to send toast\nnotifications and live tiles, check out the Microsoft-provided sample.\n\n\nOptional: Convert using Container Virtualization\nTo generate the AppX package, the electron-windows-store CLI uses a template\nthat should work for most Electron apps. However, if you are using a custom\ninstaller, or should you experience any trouble with the generated package, you\ncan attempt to create a package using compilation with a Windows Container - in\nthat mode, the CLI will install and run your application in blank Windows Container\nto determine what modifications your application is exactly doing to the operating\nsystem.\nBefore running the CLI for the first time, you will have to setup the \"Windows Desktop App\nConverter\". This will take a few minutes, but don't worry - you only have to do\nthis once. Download and Desktop App Converter from here.\nYou will receive two files: DesktopAppConverter.zip and BaseImage-14316.wim.\n\nUnzip DesktopAppConverter.zip. From an elevated PowerShell (opened with\n\"run as Administrator\", ensure that your systems execution policy allows us to\nrun everything we intend to run by calling Set-ExecutionPolicy bypass.\nThen, run the installation of the Desktop App Converter, passing in the\nlocation of the Windows base Image (downloaded as BaseImage-14316.wim), by\ncalling .\\DesktopAppConverter.ps1 -Setup -BaseImage .\\BaseImage-14316.wim.\nIf running the above command prompts you for a reboot, please restart your\nmachine and run the above command again after a successful restart.\n\nOnce installation succeeded, you can move on to compiling your Electron app.\n",

      "body": "Windows Taskbar\nElectron has APIs to configure the app's icon in the Windows taskbar. Supported\nare the creation of a JumpList,\ncustom thumbnails and toolbars,\nicon overlays, and the so-called\n\"Flash Frame\" effect, but\nElectron also uses the app's dock icon to implement cross-platform features\nlike recent documents and\napplication progress.\n\n\nJumpList\nWindows allows apps to define a custom context menu that shows up when users\nright-click the app's icon in the task bar. That context menu is called\nJumpList. You specify custom actions in the Tasks category of JumpList,\nas quoted from MSDN:\n\nApplications define tasks based on both the program's features and the key\nthings a user is expected to do with them. Tasks should be context-free, in\nthat the application does not need to be running for them to work. They\nshould also be the statistically most common actions that a normal user would\nperform in an application, such as compose an email message or open the\ncalendar in a mail program, create a new document in a word processor, launch\nan application in a certain mode, or launch one of its subcommands. An\napplication should not clutter the menu with advanced features that standard\nusers won't need or one-time actions such as registration. Do not use tasks\nfor promotional items such as upgrades or special offers.\nIt is strongly recommended that the task list be static. It should remain the\nsame regardless of the state or status of the application. While it is\npossible to vary the list dynamically, you should consider that this could\nconfuse the user who does not expect that portion of the destination list to\nchange.\n\nTasks of Internet Explorer:\n\nUnlike the dock menu in macOS which is a real menu, user tasks in Windows work\nlike application shortcuts such that when user clicks a task, a program will be\nexecuted with specified arguments.\nTo set user tasks for your application, you can use\napp.setUserTasks API:\nconst { app } = require('electron')\napp.setUserTasks([\n  {\n    program: process.execPath,\n    arguments: '--new-window',\n    iconPath: process.execPath,\n    iconIndex: 0,\n    title: 'New Window',\n    description: 'Create a new window'\n  }\n])\nTo clean your tasks list, call app.setUserTasks with an empty array:\nconst { app } = require('electron')\napp.setUserTasks([])\nThe user tasks will still show even after your application closes, so the icon\nand program path specified for a task should exist until your application is\nuninstalled.\n\n\nThumbnail Toolbars\nOn Windows you can add a thumbnail toolbar with specified buttons in a taskbar\nlayout of an application window. It provides users a way to access to a\nparticular window's command without restoring or activating the window.\nFrom MSDN, it's illustrated:\n\nThis toolbar is the familiar standard toolbar common control. It has a\nmaximum of seven buttons. Each button's ID, image, tooltip, and state are defined\nin a structure, which is then passed to the taskbar. The application can show,\nenable, disable, or hide buttons from the thumbnail toolbar as required by its\ncurrent state.\nFor example, Windows Media Player might offer standard media transport controls\nsuch as play, pause, mute, and stop.\n\nThumbnail toolbar of Windows Media Player:\n\nYou can use BrowserWindow.setThumbarButtons to set\nthumbnail toolbar in your application:\nconst { BrowserWindow } = require('electron')\nconst path = require('path')\n\nconst win = new BrowserWindow()\n\nwin.setThumbarButtons([\n  {\n    tooltip: 'button1',\n    icon: path.join(__dirname, 'button1.png'),\n    click () { console.log('button1 clicked') }\n  }, {\n    tooltip: 'button2',\n    icon: path.join(__dirname, 'button2.png'),\n    flags: ['enabled', 'dismissonclick'],\n    click () { console.log('button2 clicked.') }\n  }\n])\nTo clean thumbnail toolbar buttons, just call BrowserWindow.setThumbarButtons\nwith an empty array:\nconst { BrowserWindow } = require('electron')\n\nconst win = new BrowserWindow()\nwin.setThumbarButtons([])\n\n\nIcon Overlays in Taskbar\nOn Windows a taskbar button can use a small overlay to display application\nstatus, as quoted from MSDN:\n\nIcon overlays serve as a contextual notification of status, and are intended\nto negate the need for a separate notification area status icon to communicate\nthat information to the user. For instance, the new mail status in Microsoft\nOutlook, currently shown in the notification area, can now be indicated\nthrough an overlay on the taskbar button. Again, you must decide during your\ndevelopment cycle which method is best for your application. Overlay icons are\nintended to supply important, long-standing status or notifications such as\nnetwork status, messenger status, or new mail. The user should not be\npresented with constantly changing overlays or animations.\n\nOverlay on taskbar button:\n\nTo set the overlay icon for a window, you can use the\nBrowserWindow.setOverlayIcon API:\nconst { BrowserWindow } = require('electron')\nlet win = new BrowserWindow()\nwin.setOverlayIcon('path/to/overlay.png', 'Description for overlay')\n\n\nFlash Frame\nOn Windows you can highlight the taskbar button to get the user's attention.\nThis is similar to bouncing the dock icon on macOS.\nFrom the MSDN reference documentation:\n\nTypically, a window is flashed to inform the user that the window requires\nattention but that it does not currently have the keyboard focus.\n\nTo flash the BrowserWindow taskbar button, you can use the\nBrowserWindow.flashFrame API:\nconst { BrowserWindow } = require('electron')\nlet win = new BrowserWindow()\nwin.once('focus', () => win.flashFrame(false))\nwin.flashFrame(true)\nDon't forget to call the flashFrame method with false to turn off the flash. In\nthe above example, it is called when the window comes into focus, but you might\nuse a timeout or some other event to disable it.\n",
